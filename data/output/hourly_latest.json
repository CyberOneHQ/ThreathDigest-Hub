However, we are operating at heightened awareness, including protections against tactics, techniques and procedures that have previously been used by Iran and their allies,” said Scott Reif, chief communications officer at New York State’s Office of Information Technology Services. “As always, we remain in close contact with our federal, state and local partners on any new or evolving cybersecurity-related issues.“\n\nWidespread internet restrictions in Iran, which Tehran imposed at the start of the conflict with Israel, could be constraining hackers’ activities. A report from internet monitoring firm Censys on Monday said Iran has been in a near-total internet blackout since June 18.\n\nThe Information Technology Information Sharing and Analysis Center and the Food and Agriculture Information Sharing and Analysis Center said Monday that they had not seen any confirmed attacks against either sector in connection with the Iran threat.\n\nResearchers at Radware said they have observed a large increase in claimed distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) activity targeting U.S. critical infrastructure, including finance, government and military-linked manufacturing. Meanwhile, Israeli cyber firm Check Point Software reported that pro-Iran hacktivists were claiming responsibility for DDoS attacks on U.S. targets.",

    "full_content": "This post is also available in: עברית (Hebrew)\n\nA recent cybersecurity warning has revealed that Iran is actively exploiting weaknesses in internet-connected home security cameras across Israel, using them to monitor military and civilian activity in near real time.\n\nAccording to a report by Bloomberg, in the wake of recent hostilities between the two nations, Iranian cyber operatives have been attempting to access unsecured camera feeds to assess missile strike locations and adjust future targeting with greater precision.\n\nInternet-connected security cameras, particularly low-cost models without robust protections, are a primary vulnerability. Cameras located near sensitive areas, including military zones and civilian infrastructure, have become unintended intelligence assets for hostile actors. In one notable example, cameras installed on farms near the Gaza border have inadvertently revealed the positioning of IDF personnel.\n\nThese security breaches are part of a broader pattern seen in other global conflicts. Similar tactics were employed by Russian forces in the Ukraine conflict, where security camera footage was leveraged to monitor strategic locations.\n\nThe growing popularity of home surveillance systems—driven by concerns over theft and personal safety—has created a large network of potentially compromised devices. Many of these systems are shipped with factory-set passwords, or none at all, making them especially vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Internet of Things (IoT) search engines can easily identify exposed devices, providing attackers with a catalog of accessible feeds.\n\nExperts urge citizens to strengthen their camera security immediately. Recommendations include enabling two-factor authentication, changing default passwords, and ensuring firmware is regularly updated.\n\nThis latest development highlights the unintended risks of consumer-grade surveillance technology. Devices designed for protection are now being turned into tools of espionage, serving not just private users, but foreign intelligence as well. As geopolitical threats evolve, so too must the approach to digital and physical security in every Israeli home and business.",

The use of unsecured camera feeds by Iranian cyber operatives poses a significant threat, allowing them to assess missile strike locations and enhance targeting precision. The incident underscores the risks associated with low-cost security cameras lacking robust protections, as they inadvertently provide hostile actors with intelligence on sensitive areas like military zones and civilian infrastructure. To mitigate these risks, experts recommend immediate security measures such as enabling two-factor authentication, changing default passwords, and updating firmware on home surveillance systems.",

    "full_content": "Britain’s biggest retail lobby group has been accused of a cover up after publishing “made up” Marks & Spencer sales figures following a cyber attack on the retailer.\n\nShops were told last week that the British Retail Consortium (BRC) had been using out-of-date numbers for M&S while its systems were down, masking the true impact of the cyber attack on its sales.\n\nThe admission has provoked astonishment among members. One senior retail executive said the BRC had “effectively said to industry that the data is completely made up”.\n\nThe inaccurate figures were included in the BRC-KPMG benchmark, which is seen as a crucial tool for high street stores to understand how they are performing against competitors.\n\nAnalysts and the Government also monitor the index to track the wider health of the retail sector.\n\nThe benchmark does not break out the individual performance of each retailer, but is compiled using sales figures submitted by shops for different categories including clothing, accessories and books.\n\nThe BRC said it had used out-of-date figures for M&S because it had not received any data from the company.\n\nRather than excluding M&S, the BRC used “placeholder” numbers for weeks. These figures were based on figures from before the cyber attack, which forced the retailer to suspend online sales for months.\n\nThe practice only came to light after the BRC sent an email to members last week telling them they should be careful in using the data.\n\nOne senior retail executive said: “It’s one thing to take the number out. It’s another to add one in and make it up.”\n\nFresh setback\n\nAnalysts said the distortion of the figures risked damaging trust in the benchmark.\n\nRichard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said: “BRC members that participate in the scheme will be using it to inform their tactics and strategies all the way up to board level. There will be specific categories that potentially wouldn’t have given a clear picture of underlying trade.”\n\nThe BRC argued that excluding M&S from the benchmark would have allowed competitors to work out crucial information about the retailer, such as market share.\n\nSeparate figures suggest M&S has suffered a significant hit to sales from the cyber attack, which saw its systems frozen and customer data stolen.\n\nKantar data found that clothing sales at M&S were down by a fifth in the four weeks to May 25 compared with the same period a year earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, spending on food was nearly flat, with NIQ numbers showing spending in M&S’s food halls rose by 0.8pc in the four weeks to May 17 compared with a year earlier\n\nM&S has warned that the breach will wipe £300m from its profits after the attack reduced availability of food across its stores and stopped it from being able to accept online orders.\n\nThe retailer only resumed online orders earlier this month, more than six weeks after the attack began.",

However, it's worth noting this isn't a permanent solution as the account can stage a recovery as soon as the multiple login connections are stopped.\n\nAkamai noted that while the aforementioned methods have been used to target Monero cryptocurrency miners, they can be extended to other cryptocurrencies as well.\n\n\"The techniques presented above show how defenders can effectively shut down malicious cryptominer campaigns without disrupting the legitimate pool operation by taking advantage of pool policies,\" Dahan said.\n\n\"A legitimate miner will be able to quickly recover from this type of attack, as they can easily modify their IP or wallet locally. This task would be much more difficult for a malicious cryptominer as it would require modifying the entire botnet. For less sophisticated miners, however, this defense could completely disable the botnet.\"",
    "summary_gpt": "Cybersecurity researchers have developed two techniques to disrupt cryptocurrency mining botnets by exploiting the Stratum mining protocol, causing mining proxies or wallets to be banned and shutting down operations. The first method involves submitting consecutive bad shares to ban the mining proxy, resulting in a complete halt of mining activities. The second method targets victim miners connected directly to public pools, forcing the pool to ban the attacker's wallet by initiating more than 1,000 login requests concurrently. These techniques, primarily used against Monero miners, can be extended to other cryptocurrencies and provide a way for defenders to effectively combat malicious cryptominer campaigns without disrupting legitimate pool operations.",

The attacks, per the cybersecurity company, commence with a request from the IP address 198.199.72[.]27 to obtain a list of all containers on the machine.\n\nIf no containers are present, the attacker proceeds to create a new one based on the \"alpine\" Docker image and mounts the \"/hostroot\" directory – i.e., the root directory (\"/\") of the physical or virtual host machine – as a volume inside it. This behavior poses security risks as it allows the container to access and modify files and directories on the host system, resulting in a container escape.\n\nThe threat actors then execute a carefully orchestrated sequence of actions that involves running a Base64-encoded shell script to set up Tor on the container as part of the creation request and ultimately fetch and execute a remote script from a .onion domain (\"wtxqf54djhp5pskv2lfyduub5ievxbyvlzjgjopk6hxge5umombr63ad[.]onion\")\n\n\"It reflects a common tactic used by attackers to hide command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure, avoid detection, and deliver malware or miners within compromised cloud or container environments,\" the researchers said. \"Additionally, the attacker uses 'socks5h' to route all traffic and DNS resolution through Tor for enhanced anonymity and evasion.\"\n\nOnce the container is created, the \"docker-init.sh\" shell script is deployed, which then checks for the \"/hostroot\" directory mounted earlier and modifies the system's SSH configuration to set up remote access by enabling root login and adding an attacker-controlled SSH key into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.\n\nThe threat actor has also been found to install various tools like masscan, libpcap, zstd, and torsocks, beacon to the C&C server details about the infected system, and ultimately deliver a binary that acts as a dropper for the XMRig cryptocurrency miner, along with the necessary mining configuration, the wallet addresses, and mining pool URLs.\n\n\"This approach helps attackers avoid detection and simplifies deployment in compromised environments,\" Trend Micro said, adding it observed the activity targeting technology companies, financial services, and healthcare organizations.\n\nThe findings point to an ongoing trend of cyber attacks that target misconfigured or poorly secured cloud environments for cryptojacking purposes.\n\nThe development comes as Wiz revealed that a scan of public code repositories has uncovered hundreds of validated secrets in mcp.json, .env, and AI agent configuration files and Python notebooks (.ipynb), turning them into a treasure trove for attackers.\n\nThe cloud security firm said it found valid secrets belonging to over 30 companies and startups, including those belonging to Fortune 100 companies.\n\n\"Beyond just secrets, code execution results in Python notebooks should be generally treated as sensitive,\" researchers Shay Berkovich and Rami McCarthy said. \"Their content, if correlated to a developer's organization, can provide reconnaissance details for malicious actors.\"",

The primary task of the DLL is to load shellcode from the PNG file, resulting in the execution of the memory-resident COVENANT framework.\n\nCOVENANT subsequently downloads two more intermediate payloads that are designed to launch the BEARDSHELL backdoor on the compromised host.\n\nTo mitigate potential risks associated with the threat, state organizations are recommended to keep an eye on network traffic associated with the domains \"app.koofr[.]net\" and \"api.icedrive[.]net.\"\n\nThe disclosure comes as CERT-UA revealed APT28's targeting of outdated Roundcube webmail instances in Ukraine to deliver exploits for CVE-2020-35730, CVE-2021-44026, and CVE-2020-12641 via phishing emails that ostensibly contain text about news events but weaponize these flaws to execute arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nThe email \"contained a content bait in the form of an article from the publication 'NV' (nv.ua), as well as an exploit for the Roundcube XSS vulnerability CVE-2020-35730 and the corresponding JavaScript code designed to download and run additional JavaScript files: 'q.js' and 'e.js,'\" CERT-UA said.\n\n\"E.js\" ensures the creation of a mailbox rule for redirecting incoming emails to a third-party email address, in addition to exfiltrating the victim's address book and session cookies via HTTP POST requests. On the other hand, \"q.js\" features an exploit for an SQL injection flaw in Roundcube (CVE-2021-44026) that's used to gather information from the Roundcube database.\n\nCERT-UA said it also discovered a third JavaScript file named \"c.js\" that includes an exploit for a third Roundcube flaw (CVE-2020-12641) to execute arbitrary commands on the mail server. In all, similar phishing emails were sent to the email addresses of more than 40 Ukrainian organizations.",

It was first documented by the Belarusian CERT in early 2020.\n\nIn recent years, companies in Russia and Moldova have been targeted by various campaigns to deliver malware families like UTask, XDDown, and DSDownloader that can download additional payloads and steal sensitive information from compromised hosts.\n\nHarfangLab said it observed the threat actor leveraging a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Windows that's triggered when processing specially crafted LNK files. The vulnerability (ZDI-CAN-25373) was publicly disclosed by Trend Micro earlier this March.\n\n\"Crafted data in an LNK file can cause hazardous content in the file to be invisible to a user who inspects the file via the Windows-provided user interface,\" Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) said at the time. \"An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user.\"\n\nFurther analysis of the LNK file artifacts that exploit ZDI-CAN-25373 has uncovered a smaller subset comprising nine samples, which take advantage of an LNK parsing confusion flaw stemming as a result of Microsoft not implementing its own MS-SHLLINK specification (version 8.0).\n\nAccording to the spec, the maximum theoretical limit for the length of a string within LNK files is the greatest integer value that can be encoded within two bytes (i.e., 65,535 characters). However, the actual Windows 11 implementation limits the total stored text content to 259 characters with the exception of command-line arguments.\n\n\"This leads to confusing situations, where some LNK files are parsed differently per specification and in Windows, or even that some LNK files which should be invalid per specification are actually valid to Microsoft Windows,\" HarfangLab said.\n\n\"Because of this deviation from the specification, one can specifically craft an LNK file which seemingly executes a certain command line or even be invalid according to third-party parsers implementing the specification, while executing another command line in Windows.\"\n\nA consequence of combining the whitespace padding issue with the LNK parsing confusion is that it can be leveraged by attackers to hide the command that's being executed on both Windows UI and third-party parsers.\n\nThe nine LNK files are said to have been distributed within ZIP archives, with each of the latter containing a second ZIP archive that includes a decoy PDF file, a legitimate but renamed executable, and a rogue DLL that's sideloaded via the binary.\n\nIt's worth noting this attack chain was documented by BI.ZONE late last month as conducted by a threat actor it tracks as Silent Werewolf to infect Moldovan and Russian companies with malware.\n\nThe DLL is a first-stage downloader dubbed ETDownloader that, in turn, is likely meant to deploy a data collection implant referred to as XDigo based on infrastructure, victimology, timing, tactics, and tooling overlaps. XDigo is assessed to be a newer version of malware (\"UsrRunVGA.exe\") that was detailed by Kaspersky in October 2023.\n\nXDigo is a stealer that can harvest files, extract clipboard content, and capture screenshots. It also supports commands to execute a command or binary retrieved from a remote server over HTTP GET requests. Data exfiltration occurs via HTTP POST requests.\n\nAt least one confirmed target has been identified in the Minsk region, with other artifacts suggesting the targeting of Russian retail groups, financial institutions, large insurance companies, and governmental postal services.\n\n\"This targeting profile aligns with XDSpy's historical pursuit of government entities in Eastern Europe and Belarus in particular,\" HarfangLab said.\n\n\"XDSpy's focus is also demonstrated by its customized evasion capabilities, as their malware was reported as the first malware attempting to evade detection from PT Security's Sandbox solution, a Russian cybersecurity company providing service to public and financial organizations in the Russian Federation.\"",
    "summary_gpt": "A Go-based malware named XDigo was discovered targeting Eastern European governmental entities in March 2025, utilizing Windows shortcut (LNK) files in multi-stage attacks. The malware is part of the XDSpy cyber espionage campaign that has been active since 2011, targeting government agencies in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. The threat actor exploited a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Windows triggered by specially crafted LNK files, allowing for the execution of malicious code. XDigo is a data-stealing malware that can collect files, clipboard content, and screenshots, with data exfiltration occurring via HTTP requests.",

Russian Threat Actors Use App Passwords to Bypass MFA — Russian threat actors tracked as UNC6293 have been found to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) and access Gmail accounts of targeted individuals by leveraging app-specific passwords in skilfully-crafted social engineering attacks that impersonate U.S. Department of State officials. The attacks, which started in at least April and continued through the beginning of June, are notable for their efforts to build trust with victims over weeks, instead of inducing a false sense of urgency and rushing them into taking unintended actions. The end goal of the attacks is to persuade the recipients to create and share app-specific passwords that would provide access to their Gmail accounts.\n\n— Russian threat actors tracked as UNC6293 have been found to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) and access Gmail accounts of targeted individuals by leveraging app-specific passwords in skilfully-crafted social engineering attacks that impersonate U.S. Department of State officials.

Godfather Trojan Creates Sandbox on Infected Android Devices — A new version of the Godfather banking trojan has been found to create isolated virtual environments on Android devices to steal account data and transactions from legitimate banking apps. While the malware has been active since June 2021, the latest iteration takes its information-stealing capabilities to a whole new level through the deployment of a malicious app containing an embedded virtualization framework on infected devices, which is used to run copies of the targeted applications. Thus, when a user launches a banking app, they are redirected to the virtualized instance, from where sensitive data is stolen. The malware also displays a fake lock screen overlay to trick the victim into entering their PIN.\n\n— A new version of the Godfather banking trojan has been found to create isolated virtual environments on Android devices to steal account data and transactions from legitimate banking apps.

Israel-Iran Conflict Sparks Surge in Cyber Warfare — The Israel-Iran conflict that started with Israeli attacks on Iranian nuclear and military targets on June 13 has triggered a wider cyber conflict in the region, with hacktivist groups and ideologically motivated actors targeting both nations. Notable among them, the pro-Israel threat group known as Predatory Sparrow breached Bank Sepah and Nobitex, claiming they have been used to circumvent international sanctions. Predatory Sparrow has been publicly linked to attacks targeting an Iranian steel production facility in 2022 and for causing outages at gas station payment systems across the country in 2021. Furthermore, Iran's state-owned TV broadcaster was hacked to interrupt regular programming and air videos calling for street protests against the Iranian government. Nearly three dozen pro-Iranian groups are estimated to have launched coordinated attacks against Israeli infrastructure. These acts represent another escalation of the use of cyber attacks during (and as a precursor to) geopolitical conflicts, while also underscoring the growing importance of cyber-augmented warfare.\n\n‎️‍🔥 Trending CVEs\n\nAttackers love software vulnerabilities – they're easy doors into your systems.

BitoPro Hack Linked to Lazarus Group — Taiwanese cryptocurrency exchange BitoPro claimed the North Korean hacking group Lazarus is behind a cyber attack that led to the theft of $11,000,000 worth of cryptocurrency on May 9, 2025. \"The attack methodology bears resemblance to patterns observed in multiple past international major incidents, including illicit transfers from global bank SWIFT systems and asset theft incidents from major international cryptocurrency exchanges. These attacks are attributed to the North Korean hacking organization 'Lazarus Group,'\" the company said. BitPro also revealed the attackers conducted a social engineering attack on a team member responsible for cloud operations to implant malware and remotely access their computer, while evading security monitoring. \"They subsequently hijacked AWS Session Tokens to bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA),\" it added. \"From the AWS environment, they delivered commands via a C2 server to discreetly transfer malicious scripts to the hot wallet host, awaiting an opportunity to launch the attack. After prolonged observation, the hackers specifically targeted the platform during its wallet system upgrade and asset transfer period, simulating normal operational behaviors to launch the attack.\" On May 9, the malicious script was executed to transfer cryptocurrency from the hot wallet. BitPro said it shut down its hot wallet system, rotated all cryptographic keys, and isolated and rebuilt affected systems after discovering unusual wallet activity. The heist is the latest to be attributed to the notorious Lazarus Group, which was implicated in the record-breaking $1.5 billion theft from Bybit.\n\n— Taiwanese cryptocurrency exchange BitoPro claimed the North Korean hacking group Lazarus is behind a cyber attack that led to the theft of $11,000,000 worth of cryptocurrency on May 9, 2025. \"The attack methodology bears resemblance to patterns observed in multiple past international major incidents, including illicit transfers from global bank SWIFT systems and asset theft incidents from major international cryptocurrency exchanges.

China Targets Russia to Seek War Secrets — State-sponsored hackers from China have repeatedly broken into Russian companies and government agencies to likely look for military secrets since the country's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. According to The New York Times, intrusions accelerated in May 2022, with one group known as Sanyo impersonating the email addresses of a major Russian engineering firm to gather information on nuclear submarines. In a classified document prepared by the domestic security agency, Russia is said to have claimed that \"China is seeking Russian defense expertise and technology and is trying to learn from Russia's military experience in Ukraine,\" calling China an \"enemy.\" Another threat actor of interest is Mustang Panda, which has expanded its scope to target governmental organizations in Russia and the European Union post the Russo-Ukrainian war.\n\n— State-sponsored hackers from China have repeatedly broken into Russian companies and government agencies to likely look for military secrets since the country's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

CoinMarketCap Website Hacked With Fake \"Verify Wallet\" Pop-up — CoinMarketCap (CMC), a popular platform for cryptocurrency tracking, disclosed that its website was hacked to serve a \"malicious pop-up prompting users to 'Verify Wallet'\" with the goal of draining users digital assets. While it's currently not clear how the attackers carried out the attack, the company said it has since identified and removed the malicious code from its site. According to Coinspect Security, the drainer was injected via CoinMarketCap's rotating \"Doodles\" feature that's served from the domain api.coinmarketcap[.]com. \"CoinMarketCap's backend API serves manipulated JSON data that injects malicious JavaScript through the rotating 'doodles' feature,\" the company said. \"Not all users see it, since the doodle shown varies per visit. The injected wallet drainer always loads if you visit /doodles/.\" Specifically, this involves loading the drainer from the \"CoinmarketCLAP\" doodle's JSON file, exploiting a code injection vulnerability that exploits Lottie animation JSON files to inject arbitrary JavaScript from an external site named static.cdnkit[.]io. \"On June 20, 2025, our security team identified a vulnerability related to a doodle image displayed on our homepage,\" CoinMarketCap said. \"This doodle image contained a link that triggered malicious code through an API call, resulting in an unexpected pop-up for some users when visited (sic) our homepage.\" CoinMarketCap did not reveal how many users encountered the pop-up or whether any wallets were compromised. However, according to screenshots shared by a threat actor named ReyXBF on X, about $43,266 was siphoned from 110 victims who interacted with the fake wallet verification pop-up. \"This was a supply chain attack, meaning the breach didn't target CMC's own servers but a third-party tool or resource used by CMC,\" c/side said.\n\n— CoinMarketCap (CMC), a popular platform for cryptocurrency tracking, disclosed that its website was hacked to serve a \"malicious pop-up prompting users to 'Verify Wallet'\" with the goal of draining users digital assets.

Malicious JavaScript Served via Corrupted Version of jQuery Migrate — In another supply chain threat, cybersecurity researchers discovered a malware infection chain that employed a malicious version of a version of the jQuery Migrate library that had been altered to remotely insert and execute arbitrary JavaScript into the victim's browser. The first step in the attack was the compromise of a legitimate WordPress site (\"tabukchamber[.]sa\"), likely either via a vulnerable plugin or compromised credentials, to inject obfuscated logic related to Parrot TDS, which is designed to fingerprint the browser and selectively serve malware to qualifying users based on certain criteria. In this case, one of the tailored JavaScript responses included a dropper script disguised as jquery-migrate-3.4.1.min.js. The attack, per Trellix, unfolded when a senior executive from one of its enterprise clients accessed the WordPress website. \"This method of infection shows a well-planned, covert operation focused on blending malware into normal website behavior, leveraging the weakest link – unverified third-party frontend pipelines,\" the company said.\n\n— In another supply chain threat, cybersecurity researchers discovered a malware infection chain that employed a malicious version of a version of the jQuery Migrate library that had been altered to remotely insert and execute arbitrary JavaScript into the victim's browser.

Tesla Wall Connector Hacked to Carry Out Downgrade Attacks — Researchers demonstrated an attack technique that exploited the Tesla Wall Connector, a charger for electric vehicles, to install vulnerable firmware on the device and ultimately execute arbitrary code on the device. The attack takes advantage of the fact that Tesla vehicles can update the charging connector through a charging cable using a proprietary protocol. Synacktiv said it pulled off a successful exploit in approximately 18 minutes due to the \"low bandwidth of the SWCAN [Single-Wire Controller Area Network] bus.\" To achieve this, a Tesla car simulator was built to communicate with the charger in SWCAN communication mode, enabling them to run the downgrade logic, use Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) to extract Wi-Fi credentials, and obtain a debug shell. Furthermore, a buffer overflow in the debug shell's command parsing logic could be exploited to achieve code execution on the device. \"Since the Wall Connector is typically connected to a home, hotel, or business network, gaining access to the device could provide a foothold into the private network, potentially allowing lateral movement to other devices,\" the company said. Tesla has addressed the issue by implementing an anti-downgrade mechanism, preventing the firmware rollback used in the attack.\n\n— Researchers demonstrated an attack technique that exploited the Tesla Wall Connector, a charger for electric vehicles, to install vulnerable firmware on the device and ultimately execute arbitrary code on the device.

ASRJam Devised to Block Automated Phone Scams — A group of academics from Ben Gurion University of the Negev and Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham has developed a new framework called ASRJam that injects adversarial perturbations into a victim's audio to disrupt an attacker's Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system. Powered by a jamming algorithm dubbed EchoGuard, it leverages natural distortions, such as reverberation and echo, to counter speech recognition systems that are used by attackers to conduct vishing attacks and elicit sensitive information from victims or trick them into performing a malicious action. ASRJam \"targets the weakest link in the attacker's pipeline, speech recognition, disrupting LLM-driven vishing attacks without affecting human intelligibility,\" according to the study.\n\n— A group of academics from Ben Gurion University of the Negev and Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham has developed a new framework called ASRJam that injects adversarial perturbations into a victim's audio to disrupt an attacker's Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system.

AnonSecKh Targets Thai Entities After Border Flare-Up — A Cambodian hacktivist group has ramped up cyber attacks against Thai entities following a border skirmish between the two countries late last month that led to the death of a Cambodian soldier. The AnonsecKh group (aka ANON-KH or Bl4ckCyb3r) claimed at least 73 attacks on Thai organizations between May 28 and June 10, 2025. Targets included government websites, followed by entities in the military, manufacturing, and finance sectors. \"Their attacks are tightly linked to political incidents and demonstrate a reactive pattern,\" Radware said. \"The group has shown the ability to launch rapid and intense attack waves.\"\n\n— A Cambodian hacktivist group has ramped up cyber attacks against Thai entities following a border skirmish between the two countries late last month that led to the death of a Cambodian soldier.

More than 430 suspected victims are believed to have lost their funds after being duped into believing that they were making legitimate cryptocurrency investments. According to TRM Labs, the scheme involved directing victims to fake investment platforms that impersonated legitimate trading environments, luring them with the promise of high returns. While these services enabled smaller withdrawals, they blocked access or imposed fake tax or fee requirements when victims initiated larger withdrawal requests. As many as 144 accounts at the virtual currency exchange OKX were used for laundering the proceeds of the operation. \"These accounts exhibited patterns of coordinated activity, including the use of Vietnamese KYC documents, overlapping IP addresses geolocated in the Philippines, and KYC photographs taken in the same physical setting,\" the company said.\n\n— The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said it has filed a civil forfeiture complaint seeking to recover over $225 million in cryptocurrency linked to cryptocurrency confidence (aka romance baiting) scams running out of Vietnam and the Philippines, the largest crypto seizure by the U.S. government to date. \"The cryptocurrency addresses that held over $225.3 million in cryptocurrency were part of a sophisticated blockchain-based money laundering network that executed hundreds of thousands of transactions and was used to disperse proceeds of cryptocurrency investment fraud across many cryptocurrency addresses and accounts on the blockchain to conceal the source of the illegally obtained funds,\" the DoJ said. More than 430 suspected victims are believed to have lost their funds after being duped into believing that they were making legitimate cryptocurrency investments.

VADER to Detect and Neutralize Dead Drops — Threat actors are known to leverage legitimate and trusted platforms like Dropbox, Google Drive, and Pastebin as dead drop resolvers (DDRs) to host information that points to the actual command-and-control (C2) servers in a likely effort to sidestep detection and blend in with regular activity within enterprise networks. This also makes the malicious infrastructure more resilient, since the attackers can dynamically change the list of C2 servers, in case the original one is taken down. Enter VADER, short for Vulnerability Analysis for Dead Drop Endpoint Resolution, which aims to improve web application security through proactive Dead Drop Resolver remediation. \"Analyzing a dataset of 100,000 malware samples collected in the wild, VADER identified 8,906 DDR malware samples from 110 families that leverage 273 dead drops across seven web applications,\" academics from the Georgia Institute of Technology said. \"Additionally, it proactively uncovered 57.1% more dead drops spanning 11 web applications.\"\n\n🎥 Cybersecurity Webinars\n\nThey're Faking Your Brand — Stop AI Impersonation Before It Spreads — AI attackers are pretending to be your company, your execs—even your employees.

Use at your own risk—review the code, test safely, and apply proper safeguards.\n\n🔒 Tip of the Week\n\nSCCM Can Be a Silent Domain Takeover Tool — Here's How to Secure It ➝ Microsoft's System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) is a powerful tool for managing software and devices across an organization. But because it touches so many systems, it's also a big security risk if not set up carefully. Attackers who get access to just one user or machine can use SCCM's Client Push feature to run code remotely on other systems. This often works because SCCM uses service accounts (like Distribution Point or Network Access accounts) that have admin rights on many machines. And if your environment still allows NTLM authentication or unsigned SMB traffic, attackers can quietly hijack these connections using tools like ntlmrelayx or PetitPotam—without triggering alerts.\n\nMany IT teams miss the fact that SCCM setups often rely on shared local admin accounts, allow automatic client installs, and still support outdated security protocols. These common missteps make it easy for attackers to move through your network without being seen. What's worse, the SCCM database and SMS Provider server, which are central to pushing software and storing credentials, are rarely locked down properly—leaving attackers a clear path to take control.\n\nTo protect your network, start by turning off NTLM fallback and turning on SMB signing through Group Policy. Then check which accounts SCCM uses to install clients—remove admin rights where not needed, and rotate those credentials regularly. Make sure the SCCM database uses dedicated service accounts, limits who can connect to it, and monitors logs like ClientPushInstallation.log for anything suspicious. Use tools like LAPS or gMSA to manage local passwords safely, and place SCCM servers in their own network group behind a firewall.\n\nFinally, be careful where you run the SCCM admin console. Avoid using it on everyday laptops or general-use machines. Instead, use a secure, locked-down system just for admin work, and add protections like Credential Guard or use the RunAs /netonly command to keep admin credentials safe. When SCCM is secured properly, it blocks one of the easiest paths attackers use to spread through your network. But if it's left wide open, it can give them quiet access to almost everything.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf the signals feel louder lately, it's because they are. Attackers are refining their moves, not reinventing them—and they're counting on defenders being too busy to notice. Don't give them that edge. Sharpen your controls, simplify where you can, and keep moving faster than the threat.\n\nSecurity isn't just a solo effort—it's a shared responsibility. If this recap helped you spot something worth a second look, chances are someone else in your network needs to see it too. Share it with your team, peers, or anyone responsible for keeping systems safe. A single overlooked detail in one environment can become the blueprint for risk in another.",

The group, also tracked as Gold Feather and Water Galura, has been active since October 2022.\n\nData compiled from the dark web leak sites run by ransomware groups shows that Qilin led with 72 victims in April 2025. In May, it is estimated to be behind 55 attacks, putting it behind Safepay (72) and Luna Moth (67). It's also the third most active group after Cl0p and Akira since the start of the year, claiming a total of 304 victims.\n\n\"Qilin stands above the rest with its rapidly rising marketplace due to a mature ecosystem, extensive support options for clients, and robust solutions to ensure highly targeted, high-impact ransomware attacks designed to demand substantial payouts,\" Qualys said in an analysis of the group this week.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that affiliates working for RansomHub have migrated to Qilin, contributing to the spike in Qilin ransomware activity in recent months.\n\n\"With a growing presence across forums and ransomware activity trackers, Qilin operates a technically mature infrastructure: payloads built in Rust and C, loaders with advanced evasion features, and an affiliate panel offering Safe Mode execution, network spreading, log cleanup, and automated negotiation tools,\" researchers Mark Tsipershtein and Evgeny Ananin said.\n\n\"Beyond the malware itself, Qilin offers spam services, PB-scale data storage, legal guidance, and a full set of operational features—positioning itself not just as a ransomware group, but as a full-service cybercrime platform.\"\n\nThe decline and demise of other groups have been complemented by new updates to the Qilin affiliate panel, incorporating a new legal assistance function, a team of in-house journalists, and the ability to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Another notable addition is a tool for spamming corporate email addresses and phone numbers.\n\nThe feature expansion indicates an attempt on the part of the threat actors to market themselves as a full-fledged cybercrime service that goes beyond just ransomware.\n\n\"If you need legal consultation regarding your target, simply click the 'Call lawyer' button located within the target interface, and our legal team will contact you privately to provide qualified legal support,\" reads a translated version of a forum post announcing the new capabilities.\n\n\"The mere appearance of a lawyer in the chat can exert indirect pressure on the company and increase the ransom amount, as companies want to avoid legal proceedings.\"\n\nThe development comes as Intrinsec assessed that at least one affiliate of Rhysida has started using an open-source utility named Eye Pyramid C2 likely as a post-compromise tool to maintain access to compromised endpoints and deliver additional payloads.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Eye Pyramid C2 program refers to the same Python-based backdoor that was deployed by threat actors linked to the RansomHub crew in Q4 2024.\n\nIt also follows a fresh analysis of the leaked Black Basta chat logs, which has shed light on a threat actor who went by the online alias \"tinker.\" Their real-world identity is presently unknown.\n\nTinker, per Intel 471, is said to be one of the trusted aides of tramp, the group's leader, and joined the criminal enterprise as a \"creative director\" after having prior experience running call centers, including for the now-defunct Conti group, and as a negotiator for BlackSuit (aka Royal).\n\n\"The actor tinker played an important role in securing initial access to organizations,\" the cybersecurity company said. \"The leaked conversations reveal tinker would analyze the financial data and evaluate a victim's situation before direct negotiations.\"\n\nThe threat actor, besides conducting open-source research to obtain contact information for the company's senior staff in order to extort them either via phone calls or messages, was tasked with writing phishing emails designed to breach organizations.\n\nTinker, notably, also came up with the Microsoft Teams-based phishing scenario, wherein the attackers would masquerade as an IT department employee, warning victims that they are at the receiving end of a spam attack and urging the employees to install remote desktop tools like AnyDesk and grant them access to purportedly secure their systems.\n\n\"After the RMM software was installed, the caller would contact one of Black Basta's penetration testers, who would then move to secure persistent access to the system and domain,\" Intel 471 said.\n\nThe leaked messages also reveal that tinker received no less than $105,000 in cryptocurrency for their efforts between December 18, 2023, and June 16, 2024. That said, it's currently not clear what group they may be working for.\n\nThe findings coincide with the extradition of an unnamed 33-year-old foreign member of the Ryuk ransomware group to the United States for their alleged role as an initial access broker (IAB) and facilitating access to corporate networks. The suspect was arrested from Kyiv earlier this April at the request of U.S. law enforcement.\n\nThe member \"was engaged in the search for vulnerabilities in the corporate networks of the victim enterprises,\" the National Police of Ukraine said in a statement. \"The data obtained by the hacker was used by his accomplices to plan and carry out cyber attacks.\"\n\nAuthorities said they were able to trace the suspect following a forensic analysis of equipment seized in a previous raid that took place in November 2023 targeting members of the LockerGoga, MegaCortex, and Dharma ransomware families.\n\nElsewhere, police officials in Thailand have apprehended several Chinese nationals and other Southeast Asian suspects after raiding a hotel in Pattaya that was used as a gambling den and as an office to conduct ransomware operations.\n\nThe ransomware scheme is said to have been run by six Chinese nationals, who sent malicious links to companies in order to infect them with ransomware. Local media reports say they were employees of a cybercrime gang, who were paid to distribute the booby-trapped links to Chinese firms.\n\nThailand's Central Investigation Bureau (CIB), this week, also announced the arrest of more than a dozen foreigners as part of Operation Firestorm for allegedly running an online investment scam that defrauded several victims in Australia by calling them and deceiving them into investing their money in long-term bonds with a promise of high returns.",

It also coincides with the hack of Bank Sepah and Nobitex, Iran's largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nThe Nobitex breach led to the theft of more than $90 million, a brazen escalation in the cyber war that has simmered between Israel and Iran for more than a decade.\n\n\"Iranian entities have experimented with virtual assets as both a financial workaround and as a strategic asset to support broader geopolitical ambitions — including the proliferation of advanced weapons technology,\" TRM Labs said. \"This latest incident highlights how crypto exchanges, once peripheral to conflict, are increasingly becoming strategic targets for geopolitical actors.\"\n\nThe latest development also follows the revelation from Israeli officials that Iran is hijacking private security cameras installed in Israel to gather real-time intelligence, mirroring a similar tactic used by Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n\"We know that in the past two or three days, the Iranians have been trying to connect to cameras to understand what happened and where their missiles hit to improve their precision,\" Refael Franco, the former deputy director general of the Israel National Cyber Directorate, said.\n\nGroups claiming DDoS attacks targeting Israel between June 13 and June 18, 2025 | Source: Radware\n\nCybersecurity firm Radware said nearly 40% of all hacktivist DDoS activity has been directed against Israel since the onset of the latest flare-up. On June 17, the hacktivist group DieNet warned it would launch cyber-attacks at the United States should it join the conflict against Iran.\n\nThe message has since been amplified by other groups like Arabian Ghosts, Sylhet Gang, and Team Fearless, suggesting that these entities are forming a potential collaboration in cyberspace as battle rages on the ground.\n\n\"Companies are urged to take maximum vigilance. The warning signs are clear. Critical infrastructure, supply chains, and even global businesses could become collateral targets if the cyber crossfire intensifies,\" said Pascal Geenens, director of threat intelligence at Radware.\n\n\"The Israel-Iran conflict of 2025 is a stark illustration of modern hybrid warfare, where bytes and narratives are as much a part of the fight as bombs and missiles.\"\n\nIn a two-part analysis, CloudSEK said more than 35 distinct pro-Iranian groups have launched coordinated attacks against Israeli infrastructure, as opposed to only less than half-a-dozen pro-Israeli groups engaging in hacktivist activity.\n\n\"The attacks predominantly consisted of DDoS assaults, website defacements, and claimed data breaches targeting government sites, military systems, and critical infrastructure,\" security researcher Pagilla Manohar Reddy said.\n\n\"Most significantly, these recent attacks maintain the same pattern of exaggeration and disinformation that has characterized the broader hacktivist ecosystem, with groups continuing to take credit for unrelated service outages, recycle old data leaks, and inflate damage claims for media attention rather than achieving substantial operational impact.\"",
    "summary_gpt": "Iran's state-owned TV broadcaster was hacked to air videos calling for protests against the Iranian government, with Israel being pointed at as a potential culprit. The breach is part of a series of cyber attacks attributed to Israel-linked actors in Iran, including the hack of Bank Sepah and Nobitex, Iran's largest cryptocurrency exchange, resulting in a $90 million theft. The incident underscores the escalating cyber war between Israel and Iran, with cyber attacks increasingly targeting strategic assets like cryptocurrency exchanges. The conflict has also led to hacktivist groups threatening cyber-attacks against Israel and potentially the United States, highlighting the evolving landscape of modern hybrid warfare involving cyber tactics alongside traditional military actions.",

The attack originated from a Mirai-variant botnet in October 2024.\n\nThen in April 2025, Cloudflare revealed it defended against a massive 6.5 Tbps flood that likely emanated from Eleven11bot, a botnet comprising roughly 30,000 webcams and video recorders. The hyper-volumetric attack lasted about 49 seconds.\n\nThe 7.3 Tbps DDoS attack, in comparison, carpet-bombed an average of 21,925 destination ports of a single IP address owned and used by the hosting provider, hitting a crest of 34,517 destination ports per second.\n\nThe multi-vector attack originated from a similar distribution of source ports and has been identified as a combination of UDP flood, QOTD reflection attack, echo reflection attack, NTP reflection attack, Mirai UDP flood attack, portmap flood, and RIPv1 amplification attack. The UDP flood accounted for 99.996% of the attack traffic.\n\nCloudflare also pointed out that the attack came from over 122,145 source IP addresses spanning 5,433 Autonomous Systems (AS) across 161 countries. The top sources of attack traffic included Brazil, Vietnam, Taiwan, China, Indonesia, Ukraine, Ecuador, Thailand, the United States, and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"The average number of unique source IP addresses per second was 26,855 with a peak of 45,097,\" Yoachimik said.\n\n\"Telefonica Brazil (AS27699) accounted for the largest portion of the DDoS attack traffic, responsible for 10.5% of the total. Viettel Group (AS7552) follows closely with 9.8%, while China Unicom (AS4837) and Chunghwa Telecom (AS3462) contributed 3.9% and 2.9% respectively. China Telecom (AS4134) accounted for 2.8% of the traffic.\"\n\nThe disclosure comes as the QiAnXin XLab team said the DDoS botnet tracked as RapperBot was behind an attack aimed at artificial intelligence (AI) company DeepSeek in February 2025, and that the latest samples of the malware attempt to extort victims, demanding they pay \"protection fees\" to the tune of $5,000 in XMR to avoid being targeted by DDoS attacks in the future.\n\nChina, the United States, Israel, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Greece, Iran, Australia, Malaysia, and Thailand are the primary countries where devices infected by RapperBot are located. The botnet is known to be active since 2022.\n\nRapperBot campaigns are known to target routers, network-attached storage devices, and video recorders with default weak passwords or firmware vulnerabilities to obtain initial access, and drop malware that can establish contact with a remote server over DNS TXT records to fetch DDoS attack commands.\n\nThe malware also makes use of custom encryption algorithms to encrypt the TXT records and command-and-control (C2) domain names used.\n\n\"Since March, its attack behavior has been significantly active, with an average of more than 100 attack targets per day and more than 50,000 bots observed,\" the Chinese security vendor said.\n\n\"RapperBot's attack targets are all over the fields of various industries, including public management, social security and social organizations, Internet platforms, manufacturing, financial services, etc.\"\n\nUpdate\n\nThe marked spike in RapperBot activity coincides with a new report from Japan's NICT on the botnet's attacks on IoT devices, using a combination of brute-force attacks and zero-day exploits in DVRs made by ITX Security. The vulnerabilities have since been addressed.\n\nThe malware, stemming from the infamous Mirai botnet, gets its name from a URL that led to a YouTube rap video in early versions.",

    "full_content": "Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new campaign in which the threat actors have published more than 67 GitHub repositories that claim to offer Python-based hacking tools, but deliver trojanized payloads instead.\n\nThe activity, codenamed Banana Squad by ReversingLabs, is assessed to be a continuation of a rogue Python campaign that was identified in 2023 as targeting the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository with bogus packages that were downloaded over 75,000 times and came with information-stealing capabilities on Windows systems.\n\nThe findings build on a previous report from the SANS's Internet Storm Center in November 2024 that detailed a supposed \"steam-account-checker\" tool hosted on GitHub, which incorporated stealthy features to download additional Python payloads that can inject malicious code into the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet app and harvest sensitive data to an external server (\"dieserbenni[.]ru\").\n\nFurther analysis of the repository and the attacker-controlled infrastructure has led to the discovery of 67 trojanized GitHub repositories that impersonate benign repositories with the same name.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that users searching for software such as account cleaning tools and game cheats such as Discord account cleaner, Fortnite External Cheat, TikTok username checker, and PayPal bulk account checker are the targets of the campaign. All the identified repositories have since been taken down by GitHub.\n\n\"Backdoors and trojanized code in publicly available source code repositories like GitHub are becoming more prevalent and represent a growing software supply chain attack vector,\" ReversingLabs researcher Robert Simmons said.\n\n\"For developers relying on these open-source platforms, it's essential to always double check that the repository you're using actually contains what you expect.\"\n\nGitHub as a Malware Distribution Service\n\nThe development comes as GitHub is increasingly becoming the focus of several campaigns as a malware distribution vector. Earlier this week, Trend Micro said it uncovered 76 malicious GitHub repositories operated by a threat actor it calls Water Curse to deliver multi-stage malware.\n\nThese payloads are designed to siphon credentials, browser data, and session tokens, as well as to provide the threat actors with persistent remote access to the compromised systems.\n\nThen Check Point shed light on another campaign that's using a criminal service known as the Stargazers Ghost Network to target Minecraft users with Java-based malware. The Stargazers Ghost Network refers to a collection of GitHub accounts that propagate malware or malicious links via phishing repositories.\n\n\"The network consists of multiple accounts that distribute malicious links and malware and perform other actions such as starring, forking, and subscribing to malicious repositories to make them appear legitimate,\" Check Point said.\n\nThe cybersecurity company has also assessed that such \"GitHub 'Ghost' accounts are only one part of the grand picture, with other 'Ghost' accounts operating on different platforms as an integral part of an even larger Distribution-as-a-Service universe.\"\n\nSome aspects of the Stargazers Ghost Network were exposed by Checkmarx in April 2024, calling out the threat actor's pattern of using fake stars and pushing out frequent updates to artificially inflate the popularity of the repositories and make sure they surfaced on top of GitHub search results.\n\nThese repositories are ingeniously disguised as legitimate projects, typically related to popular games, cheats, or tools like cryptocurrency price trackers and multiplier prediction for crash-betting games.\n\nThese campaigns also dovetail with another attack wave that has targeted novice cybercriminals on the lookout for readily available malware and attack tools on GitHub with backdoored repositories to infect them with information stealers.\n\nIn one instance highlighted by Sophos this month, the trojanized Sakura-RAT repository has been found to incorporate malicious code that compromised those who compiled the malware on their systems with information stealers and other remote access trojans (RATs).\n\nThe identified repositories act as a conduit for four different kinds of backdoors that are embedded within Visual Studio PreBuild events, Python scripts, screensaver files, and JavaScript to steal data, take screenshots, communicate via Telegram, as well as fetch more payloads, including AsyncRAT, Remcos RAT, and Lumma Stealer.\n\nIn all, the cybersecurity company said it detected no less than 133 backdoored repositories as part of the campaign, with 111 containing the PreBuild backdoor, and the others hosting Python, screensaver, and JavaScript backdoors.\n\nSophos further noted that these activities are likely linked to a distribution-as-a-service operation that has been operational since August 2022, and which has used thousands of GitHub accounts to distribute malware embedded within trojanized repositories themed around gaming cheats, exploits, and attack tools.\n\nWhile the exact distribution method used in the campaign is unclear, it's believed that the threat actors are also relying on Discord servers and YouTube channels to spread links to the trojanized repositories.\n\n\"It remains unclear if this campaign is directly linked to some or all of the previous campaigns reported on, but the approach does seem to be popular and effective, and is likely to continue in one form or another,\" Sophos said. \"In the future, it's possible that the focus may change, and threat actors may target other groups besides inexperienced cybercriminals and gamers who use cheats.\"\n\nChet Wisniewski, director and field CISO at Sophos, told The Hacker News that \"there are striking similarities\" between the campaign and Water Curse. These encompass traits such as -\n\nRepositories with \"extremely similar names\"\n\nBroad use of GitHub accounts\n\nA similar focus on Electron applications\n\nSimilar abuse of Visual Studio's PreBuild elements, and\n\nA reference to the \"ischhfd83\" email address (\"ischhfd83@rambler[.]ru\"), which is used to make the commits to the GitHub repositories\n\n\"Whether these campaigns are closely related or simply part of a threat cluster working from the same codebase and playbook merits further investigation,\" Wisniewski added.",

It also establishes a WebSocket communication to facilitate real-time, bi-directional communication between the infected device and an external server.\n\nIn December 2024, Zimperium revealed details of a mobile phishing campaign that distributed an updated version of AntiDot dubbed AppLite Banker using job offer-themed decoys.\n\nThe latest findings from the Swiss cybersecurity company show that there are at least 11 active command-and-control (C2) servers in operation that are overseeing no less than 3,775 infected devices across 273 distinct campaigns.\n\nA Java-based malware at its core, AntiDot is heavily obfuscated using a commercial packer to sidestep detection and analysis efforts. The malware, per PRODAFT, is delivered as part of a three-stage process that starts with an APK file.\n\n\"An inspection of the AndroidManifest file reveals that many class names do not appear in the original APK,\" the company said. \"These missing classes are dynamically loaded by the packer during installation, and include malicious code extracted from an encrypted file. The entire mechanism is intentionally crafted to avoid detection by antivirus tools.\"\n\nOnce launched, it serves a bogus update bar and prompts the victim to grant it accessibility permissions, after which it unpacks and loads a DEX file incorporating the botnet functions.\n\nA core feature of AntiDot is its ability to monitor for newly launched applications and serve and serve a bogus login screen from the C2 server when the victim opens a cryptocurrency- or payment-related app that the operators are interested in.\n\nThe malware also abuses accessibility services to gather extensive information about the contents of the active screens and sets itself as the default SMS app for capturing incoming and outgoing texts. Furthermore, it can monitor phone calls, block calls from specific numbers, or redirect them, effectively opening up more avenues for fraud.\n\nAnother important feature is that it can keep track of real-time notifications displayed in the device's status bar and takes steps to either dismiss or snooze them in a bid to suppress alerts and avoid alerting the user of suspicious activity.\n\nPRODAFT said the C2 panel that powers the remote control functions is built using MeteorJS, an open-source JavaScript framework that enables real-time communication. The panel has six different tabs -\n\nBots, which displays a list of all the compromised devices and their details\n\nInjects, which displays a list of all target apps for overlay injection and view the overlay template for each inject\n\nAnalytic, which displays a list of applications installed on victim devices and likely used to identify new and popular apps for future targeting\n\nSettings, which contains the core configuration options for the panel, including updating the injects\n\nGates, which is used to manage the infrastructure endpoints that the bots connect to\n\nHelp, which offers support resources for using the malware\n\n\"AntiDot represents a scalable and evasive MaaS platform designed for financial gain through persistent control of mobile devices, especially in localized and language-specific regions,\" the company said. \"The malware also employs WebView injection and overlay attacks to steal credentials, making it a serious threat to user privacy and device security.\"\n\nGodFather Returns\n\nThe development arrives as Zimperium zLabs said it uncovered a \"sophisticated evolution\" of the GodFather Android banking trojan that makes use of on-device virtualization to hijack legitimate mobile banking and cryptocurrency applications and carry out real-time fraud.\n\n\"The core of this novel technique is the malware's ability to create a complete, isolated virtual environment on the victim's device. Instead of simply mimicking a login screen, the malware installs a malicious 'host' application that contains a virtualization framework,\" researchers Fernando Ortega and Vishnu Pratapagiri said.\n\n\"This host then downloads and runs a copy of the actual targeted banking or cryptocurrency app within its controlled sandbox.\"\n\nShould the victim launch the app, they are redirected to the virtual instance, from where their activities are monitored by the threat actors. In addition, the latest version of GodFather packs in features to bypass static analysis tools by making use of ZIP manipulation and filling the AndroidManifest file with irrelevant permissions.\n\nLike in the case of AntiDot, GodFather relies on accessibility services to conduct its information gathering activities and control compromised devices. While Google has enforced security protections that prevent sideloaded apps from enabling accessibility services starting Android 13, a session-based installation approach can get around this safeguard.\n\nThe session-based method is used by Android app stores to handle app installation, as do texting apps, mail clients, and browsers when presented with APK files.\n\nCentral to the functioning of the malware is its virtualization feature. In the first stage, it collects information about the list of installed apps and checks if it includes any of the predetermined apps it's configured to target.\n\nIf matches are found, it extracts relevant information from those apps and then proceeds to install a copy of those apps in a virtual environment inside the dropper app. Thus when the victim attempts to launch the actual banking application on their device, GodFather intercepts the action and opens the virtualized instance instead.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that similar virtualization features were previously flagged in another Android malware codenamed FjordPhantom, which was documented by Promon in December 2023. The method represents a paradigm shift in mobile threat capabilities that go beyond the traditional overlay tactic to steal credentials and other sensitive data.\n\n\"While this GodFather campaign casts a wide net, targeting nearly 500 applications globally, our analysis reveals that this highly sophisticated virtualization attack is currently focused on a dozen Turkish financial institutions,\" the company said.\n\n\"A particularly alarming capability uncovered in the GodFather malware is its capacity to steal device lock credentials, irrespective of whether the victim uses an unlock pattern, a PIN, or a password. This poses a significant threat to user privacy and device security.\"\n\nThe mobile security company said the abuse of accessibility services is one of the many ways malicious apps can achieve privilege escalation on Android, allowing them to obtain permissions that exceed their functional requirements. These include misuse of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) permissions and security vulnerabilities in pre-installed apps that cannot be removed by users.\n\n\"Preventing privilege escalation and securing Android ecosystems against malicious or over-privileged applications requires more than user awareness or reactive patching -- it demands proactive, scalable, and intelligent defense mechanisms,\" security researcher Ziv Zeira said.\n\nIn a statement shared with The Hacker News, Google said it did not detect any apps containing the malware on Google Play and that Android users are protected against the threat through Google Play Protect.\n\n\"Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services,\" a spokesperson said. \"Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.\"\n\nSuperCard X Malware Comes to Russia\n\nThe findings also follow the first recorded attempts to target Russian users with SuperCard X, a newly emerged Android malware that can conduct near-field communication (NFC) relay attacks for conducting fraudulent transactions.\n\nAccording to Russian cybersecurity company F6, SuperCard X is a malicious modification of a legitimate tool called NFCGate that can capture or modify NFC traffic. The end goal of the malware is to not only receive NFC traffic from the victim, but also bank card data read by sending commands to its EMV chip.\n\n\"This application allows attackers to steal bank card data by intercepting NFC traffic for subsequent theft of money from users' bank accounts,\" F6 researcher Alexander Koposov said in a report published this week.\n\nAttacks leveraging SuperCard X were first spotted targeting Android users in Italy earlier this year, weaponizing NFC technology to relay data from victims' physical cards to attacker-controlled devices, from where they were used to carry out fraudulent ATM withdrawals or authorize point-of-sale (PoS) payments.\n\nThe Chinese-speaking MaaS platform, advertised on Telegram as capable of targeting customers of major banks in the U.S., Australia and Europe, shares substantial code-level overlaps with NGate, an Android malware that has also been found weaponizing NFCGate for malicious purposes in the Czech Republic.\n\nAll these campaigns are united by the fact that they rely on smishing techniques to convince a potential victim of the need to install an APK file on the device under the guise of a useful program.\n\nMalicious Apps Spotted on App Stores\n\nWhile all of the aforementioned malware strains require victims to sideload the apps on their devices, new research has also unearthed malicious apps on the official Google Play Store and Apple's App Store with capabilities to harvest personal information and steal mnemonic phrases associated with cryptocurrency wallets with the goal of draining their assets.\n\nOne of the apps in question, RapiPlata, is estimated to have been downloaded around 150,000 times on both Android and iOS devices, underscoring the severity of the threat. The app is a type of malware known as SpyLoan, which lures users by claiming to offer loans at low-interest rates, only to be subjected to extortion, blackmail, and data theft.\n\n\"RapiPlata primarily targets Colombian users by promising quick loans,\" Check Point said. \"Beyond its predatory lending practices, the app engages in extensive data theft. The app had extensive access to sensitive user data -- including SMS messages, call logs, calendar events, and installed applications -- even going so far as to upload this data to its servers.\"\n\nThe cryptocurrency wallet phishing apps, on the other hand, have been distributed through compromised developer accounts and serve a phishing page via WebView to obtain the seed phrases.\n\nAlthough these apps have since been removed from the respective app stores, the danger is that the Android apps could be available for download from third-party app marketplaces. Users are advised to exercise caution when downloading financial or loan-related applications.\n\n(The story was updated after publication to include a response from Google.)",

The link to the extension, shared via Telegram, downloaded an AppleScript that went by the name \"zoom_sdk_support.scpt.\"\n\nThis AppleScript first opens a legitimate webpage for the Zoom software development kit (SDK), but is also configured to stealthily download a next-stage payload from a remote server (\"support[.]us05web-zoom[.]biz\") and executes a shell script.\n\nThe script begins by disabling bash history logging and then checks if Rosetta 2 is installed on the compromised Mac, and if not, installs it. Rosetta is a software that enables Macs running Apple silicon to run apps that were built for a Mac with an Intel processor (x86_64).\n\nThe script then proceeds to create a hidden file called \".pwd,\" and downloads a binary from the malicious Zoom web page (\"web071zoom[.lus/fix/audio-fv/7217417464\") to the \"/tmp/icloud_helper\" directory. It also performs another request to \"web071zoom[.]us/fix/audio-tr/7217417464\" to fetch another unspecified payload.\n\nThe shell script also prompts the user to provide their system password and wipes the history of executed commands to avoid leaving a forensic trail. Huntress said its investigation led to the discovery of eight distinct malicious binaries on the victim host -\n\nTelegram 2 , a Nim-based binary responsible for starting the primary backdoor\n\n, a Nim-based binary responsible for starting the primary backdoor Root Troy V4 , a fully-featured Go backdoor that's used to run remote AppleScript payloads, shell commands, and download additional malware and execute them\n\n, a fully-featured Go backdoor that's used to run remote AppleScript payloads, shell commands, and download additional malware and execute them InjectWithDyld , a C++ binary loader downloaded by Root Troy V4, which, in turn, drops two more payloads: A benign Swift application to facilitate process injection and a different Nim implant that enables the operator to issue commands and receive responses asynchronously\n\n, a C++ binary loader downloaded by Root Troy V4, which, in turn, drops two more payloads: A to facilitate process injection and a different that enables the operator to issue commands and receive responses asynchronously XScreen , an Objective-C keylogger with features to monitor the victim's keystrokes, clipboard, and the screen, and send the information to a command-and-control (C2) server\n\n, an Objective-C keylogger with features to monitor the victim's keystrokes, clipboard, and the screen, and send the information to a command-and-control (C2) server CryptoBot , a Go-based information stealer that can collect cryptocurrency related files from the host\n\n, a Go-based information stealer that can collect cryptocurrency related files from the host NetChk, an almost empty binary that's designed to generate random numbers forever\n\nBlueNoroff, also tracked under the names Alluring Pisces, APT38, Black Alicanto, Copernicium, Nickel Gladstone, Stardust Chollima, and TA444, is a sub-cluster within the Lazarus Group that has a history of striking financial institutions, cryptocurrency businesses, and ATMs for monetary gain and generate revenue for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).\n\nThe group is best known for orchestrating a series of cryptocurrency heists known as TraderTraitor to target employees of organizations engaged in blockchain research with malicious cryptocurrency trading applications. Some of the significant cases include the hacks of Bybit in February 2025 and Axie Infinity in March 2022.\n\n\"Remote workers, especially in high-risk areas of work, are often the ideal targets for groups like TA444,\" Huntress said. \"It is important to train employees to identify common attacks that start off with social engineering related to remote meeting software.\"\n\nAccording to DTEX's latest assessment of North Korea's cyber structure, the APT38 mission likely no longer exists and has fractured into TraderTraitor (aka Jade Sleet and UNC4899) and CryptoCore (aka CageyChameleon, CryptoMimic, DangerousPassword, LeeryTurtle, and Sapphire Sleet), with the two clusters becoming the new faces of financial theft for the regime.\n\n\"TraderTraitor is arguably the most prolific of any of the DPRK APT groups when it comes to cryptocurrency theft and seems to have housed the most talent from the original APT38 effort,\" DTEX said. \"CryptoCore has been active since at least 2018, likely splitting out of APT38 with TraderTraitor.\"\n\nWhat's more, the use of audio issue-themed lures to trick prospective victims into compromising their own machines with malware has its echoes in an evolution of another North Korea-linked campaign dubbed Contagious Interview, which involves using ClickFix-style alerts to deliver a Go-based malware named GolangGhost.\n\nThe new iteration, referred to as ClickFake Interview, revolves around creating fake job advertisements and duping job applicants into copying and running a malicious command under the pretext of addressing an issue with accessing camera and microphone on a fake website set up by the threat actors to complete their hiring assessment.\n\n\"It does appear to be roughly the same techniques used in both of these scenarios, and that makes sense – since these techniques work,\" Levy said. \"These different groups could most likely be part of the same larger team, or sharing techniques that work, in order to ensure that all of their efforts are effective.\"\n\nThese cross-platform attacks, per Cisco Talos, have since evolved further, employing a Python version of GolangGhost that has been codenamed PylangGhost. The bogus assessment sites impersonate well-known financial entities such as Archblock, Coinbase, Robinhood, and Uniswap, and have been found to target a small set of users mainly located in India.\n\n\"In recent campaigns, the threat actor Famous Chollima — potentially made up of multiple groups — has been using a Python-based version of their trojan to target Windows systems, while continuing to deploy a Golang-based version for MacOS users,\" security researcher Vanja Svajcer said. \"Linux users are not targeted in these latest campaigns.\"\n\nPylangGhost, like its Golang counterpart, establishes contact with a C2 server to receive commands that enable the attackers to remotely control the infected machine, download/upload files, as well as steal cookies and credentials from over 80 browser extensions, including password managers and cryptocurrency wallets.\n\n\"It is not clear [...] why the threat actors decided to create two variants using a different programming language, or which was created first,\" Talos remarked. \"The structure, the naming conventions and the function names are very similar, which indicates that the developers of the different versions either worked closely together or are the same person.\"\n\nUpdate\n\nMore details have since emerged about BlueNoroff's use of fake Zoom domains (\"usweb08[.]us\") that mimic the legitimate user interface of the videoconferencing solution to deceive users into downloading malware as part of what has been described as a \"sophisticated scam attempt disguised as a Zoom meeting.\"\n\n\"It started with a message on LinkedIn from Valéria Pereira account claiming to be interested in what my company does,\" Eugene Vyborov, founder and CEO of Ability AI, said in a message posted on LinkedIn. \"They asked to continue the conversation via Telegram. Once there, they booked a meeting via my calendar link — nothing suspicious so far.\"\n\nThe threat actors, per Vyborov, sent a message 20 minutes before the scheduled call asking him to join the meeting via a link, stating their \"team\" was already on it.\n\n\"My audio 'wasn't connecting,' and I was redirected to a fake Zoom 'help' page prompting me to run terminal commands to fix it,\" Vyborov added. \"At that point, I stopped engaging. When I insisted on switching to Google Meet, they pushed back saying “company policy” prevented that. Minutes later, they deleted our entire Telegram chat and vanished.\"\n\nIn a similar attack, Canadian cybersecurity company Field Effect said an employee of a Canadian online gambling provider fell victim to a similar attack in late May 2025 and ended up with information-stealing malware on their macOS system.\n\nThe attack chain is designed to entice victims into joining the bogus Zoom call and coax them to download a malicious payload that masquerades as an audio repair tool to address purported audio issues. The AppleScript then proceeds to fetch a secondary shell script using curl and execute it using zsh.\n\nThe newly downloaded script prompts the user to enter their system password, after which more tools are dropped onto the system, including a loader that's responsible for fetching an implant, along with a stealer that can harvest and exfiltrate iCloud Keychain and web browser data.\n\n\"Also noteworthy is that this activity was conducted in parallel with ongoing loader activity to persistently install the primary malware implant, resulting in an extremely fast infection chain, with first data exfiltration observed even before the malware had fully been installed,\" Field Effect said.",
    "summary_gpt": "The North Korea-aligned threat actor BlueNoroff targeted a Web3 sector employee with deceptive Zoom calls using deepfaked company executives to distribute malware on Apple macOS devices. The attack involved a fake Zoom domain controlled by the threat actor, leading the victim to download an AppleScript disguised as a Zoom extension. The malicious script downloaded multiple payloads, including backdoors, a binary loader, and a keylogger, posing a significant threat to the victim's system security and privacy. This incident highlights the sophisticated tactics used by threat actors to exploit human vulnerabilities and infiltrate organizations through social engineering techniques.",

The company said it has since taken steps to secure the accounts compromised by the campaigns.\n\nUNC6293's ties to APT29 stem from a series of similar social engineering attacks that have leveraged novel techniques like device code phishing and device join phishing to gain unauthorized access to Microsoft 365 accounts since the start of the year.\n\nDevice join phishing is particularly noteworthy for the fact that it tricks victims into sending back to the attackers a Microsoft-generated OAuth code to hijack their accounts.\n\n\"Since April 2025, Microsoft has observed suspected Russian-linked threat actors using third-party application messages or emails referencing upcoming meeting invitations to deliver a malicious link containing valid authorization code,\" Microsoft revealed last month.\n\n\"When clicked, the link returns a token for the Device Registration Service, allowing registration of the threat actor's device to the tenant.\"",

It essentially permits an \"allow_active\" user to gain full root privileges by chaining it with CVE-2025-6018.\n\n\"Although it nominally requires 'allow_active' privileges, udisks ships by default on almost all Linux distributions, so nearly any system is vulnerable,\" Abbasi added. \"Techniques to gain 'allow_active,' including the PAM issue disclosed here, further negate that barrier.\"\n\nOnce root privileges are obtained, an attacker has carte blanche access to the system, allowing them use it as a springboard for broader post-compromise actions, such as altering security controls and implanting backdoors for covert access.\n\nQualys said it has developed proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits to confirm the presence of these vulnerabilities on various operating systems, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and openSUSE Leap 15.\n\nTo mitigate the risk posed by these flaws, it's essential to apply patches provided by the Linux distribution vendors.

The issue has been fixed in version 1.7.1.\n\n\"The module pam_namespace in linux-pam <= 1.7.0 may access user-controlled paths without proper protections, which allows a local user to elevate their privileges to root via multiple symlink attacks and race conditions,\" Linux PAM maintainer Dmitry V. Levin said.\n\nLinux systems are vulnerable if they use pam_namespace to set up polyinstantiated directories for which the path to either the polyinstantiated directory or instance directory is under user-control. As workarounds for CVE-2025-6020, users can disable pam_namespace or ensure it does not operate on user-controlled paths.\n\nANSSI's Olivier Bal-Petre, who reported the flaw to the maintainers on January 29, 2025, said users should also update their namespace.init script if they do not use the one provided by their distribution to ensure that the either of two paths are safe to operate on as root.",

These shortcuts are disguised as documents to trick victims into opening them, effectively activating the infection sequence.\n\nThe elaborate multi-step process culminates in the execution of a Python-based shellcode loader that executes payloads packed with the open-source Donut loader entirely in memory.\n\nSecuronix said the campaign has targeted the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and other regions across Europe and Asia. The identity of the threat actor(s) behind the campaign is presently unknown, although the cybersecurity company pointed out their English fluency.\n\nThe threat activity cluster is also notable for its shifting initial access methods, pivoting from internet shortcut (URL) files to using LNK shortcut files masquerading as PDF documents. These payloads are then used to retrieve additional stages over WebDAV via the Cloudflare Tunnel subdomains.\n\nIt's worth mentioning here that a variation of this campaign was previously documented by eSentire and Proofpoint last year, with the attacks paving the way for AsyncRAT, GuLoader, PureLogs Stealer, Remcos RAT, Venom RAT, and XWorm.\n\n\"While the infrastructure and delivery mechanics are very similar, there is definitely evidence to suggest that the SERPENTINE#CLOUD campaign could be a continuation of a prior campaign, though with notable differences,\" Peck told the Hacker News.\n\n\"The differences in payload complexity and targeting suggest they may be unrelated or represent distinct threat actors converging on a popular tactic that simply works.\"\n\nSome of these differences include the use of extensive code obfuscation, additional stages to help it slide under the radar, and the deployment of Python shellcode loaders to deliver the main payloads, as opposed to directly serving commodity malware.\n\n\"Given the similarities, it's possible that the same threat actors behind it have retooled and modernized their attack chain, or it's possible that this could be an entirely different threat actor who is capitalizing on known attack chains that prove effective,\" Peck added.\n\nThe abuse of TryCloudflare offers manifold advantages. For starters, malicious actors have long made it harder to detect by using legitimate cloud service providers as a front for their operations, including payload delivery and command-and-control (C2) communication.\n\nBy using a reputable subdomain (\"*.trycloudflare[.]com\") for nefarious ends, it makes it exceedingly tough for defenders to distinguish between harmful and benign activities, thereby allowing it to evade URL or domain-based blocking mechanisms.\n\nFurthermore, it obviates the need to register domains or rent VPS servers, as well as allows the attackers to host malicious content on a local machine and expose them to the public internet with a temporary \"*.trycloudflare[.]com\" subdomain.\n\nThe initial infection occurs when the LNK files are launched, causing it to download a next-stage payload, a Windows Script File (WSF), from a remote WebDAV share hosted on a Cloudflare Tunnel subdomain. The WSF file is subsequently executed using cscript.exe in a manner without arousing the victim's suspicion.\n\n\"This WSF file functions as a lightweight VBScript-based loader, designed to execute an external batch file from a second Cloudflare domain,\" Peck said. \"The 'kiki.bat' file serves as the main payload delivery script next in the series of stagers. Overall, it's designed for stealth and persistence.\"\n\nThe primary responsibility of the batch script is to display a decoy PDF document, check for antivirus software, and download and execute Python payloads, which are then used to run Donut-packed payloads like AsyncRAT or Revenge RAT in memory.\n\nSecuronix said there is a possibility that the script may have been vibe-coded using a large language model owing to the presence of well-defined comments in the source code.\n\n\"The SERPENTINE#CLOUD campaign is a complex and layered infection chain that blends a bit of social engineering, living-off-the-land techniques, and evasive in-memory code execution,\" the company concluded. \"The abuse of Cloudflare Tunnel infrastructure further complicates network visibility by giving the actor a disposable and encrypted transport layer for staging malicious files without maintaining traditional infrastructure.\"\n\nShadow Vector Targets Colombian Users via SVG Smuggling\n\nThe disclosure comes as Acronis identified an active malware campaign dubbed Shadow Vector targeting users in Colombia using booby-trapped scalable vector graphics (SVG) files as the malware delivery vector in phishing emails that impersonate court notifications.\n\n\"Attackers distributed spear-phishing emails impersonating trusted institutions in Colombia, delivering SVG decoys with embedded links to JS / VBS stagers hosted on public platforms, or password-protected ZIP files containing the payloads directly,\" Acronis researchers Santiago Pontiroli, Jozsef Gegeny, and Ilia Dafchev said.\n\nThe attacks led to the deployment of remote access trojans like AsyncRAT and Remcos RAT, with recent campaigns also utilizing a .NET loader associated with Katz Stealer. These attack chains involve hiding the payloads within Base64-encoded text of image files hosted on the Internet Archive.\n\nA noteworthy aspect of the campaign is the use of SVG smuggling techniques to deliver malicious ZIP archives using SVG files. These payloads are hosted on file-sharing services such as Bitbucket, Dropbox, Discord, and YDRAY. The download archives contain both legitimate executables and malicious DLLs, the latter of which are sideloaded to ultimately serve the trojans.\n\n\"A natural evolution from its earlier SVG smuggling techniques, this threat actor has adopted a modular, memory-resident loader that can execute payloads dynamically and entirely in memory, leaving minimal traces behind,\" the researchers said.\n\n\"The presence of Portuguese-language strings and method parameters within the loader mirrors TTPs commonly observed in Brazilian banking malware, suggesting potential code reuse, shared development resources or even cross-regional actor collaboration.\"\n\nClickFix Surge Propels Drive-By Compromises\n\nThe findings also coincide with a rise in social engineering attacks that employ the ClickFix tactic to deploy stealers and remote access trojans like Lumma Stealer and SectopRAT under the guise of fixing an issue or completing a CAPTCHA verification.\n\nTop 3 malware families distributed via ClickFix between March and May 2025\n\nAccording to statistics shared by ReliaQuest, drive-by compromises accounted for 23% of all phishing-based tactics observed between March and May 2025. \"Techniques like ClickFix were central to drive-by downloads,\" the cybersecurity company said.\n\nClickFix is effective primarily because it deceives targets into carrying out seemingly harmless, everyday actions that are unlikely to raise any red flags, because they're so used to seeing CAPTCHA screening pages and other notifications. What makes it compelling is that it gets users to do the main work of infecting their own machines instead of having to resort to more sophisticated methods like exploiting software flaws.\n\n\"External remote resources dropped from third to fourth place as attackers increasingly exploit user mistakes rather than technical vulnerabilities,\" ReliaQuest said. \"This shift is likely driven by the simplicity, success rate, and universal applicability of social engineering campaigns like ClickFix.\"",

    "full_content": "A new multi-stage malware campaign is targeting Minecraft users with a Java-based malware that employs a distribution-as-service (DaaS) offering called Stargazers Ghost Network.\n\n\"The campaigns resulted in a multi-stage attack chain targeting Minecraft users specifically,\" Check Point researchers Jaromír Hořejší and Antonis Terefos said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\n\"The malware was impersonating Oringo and Taunahi, which are 'Scripts and macros tools' (aka cheats). Both the first and second stages are developed in Java and can only be executed if the Minecraft runtime is installed on the host machine.\"\n\nThe end goal of the attack is to trick players into downloading a Minecraft mod from GitHub and deliver a .NET information stealer with comprehensive data theft capabilities. The campaign was first detected by the cybersecurity company in March 2025.\n\nWhat makes the activity notable is its use of an illicit offering called the Stargazers Ghost Network, which makes use of thousands of GitHub accounts to set up tainted repositories that masquerade as cracked software and game cheats.\n\nTerefos told The Hacker News that they flagged \"approximately 500 GitHub repositories, including those that are forked or copied,\" adding \"We've also seen 700 stars produced by approximately 70 accounts.\"\n\nThese malicious repositories, masquerading as Minecraft mods, serve as a conduit for infecting users of the popular video game with a Java loader (e.g., \"Oringo-1.8.9.jar\") that remains undetected by all antivirus engines as of writing.\n\nThe Java archive (JAR) files implement simple anti-VM and anti-analysis techniques to sidestep detection efforts. Their main objective is to download and run another JAR file, a second-stage stealer that fetches and executes a .NET stealer as the final payload when the game is started by the victim.\n\nThe second-stage component is retrieved from an IP address (\"147.45.79.104\") that's stored in Base64-encoded format Pastebin, essentially turning the paste tool into a dead drop resolver.\n\n\"To add mods to a Minecraft game, the user must copy the malicious JAR archive into the Minecraft mods folder. After starting the game, the Minecraft process will load all mods from the folder, including the malicious mod, which will download and execute the second stage,\" the researchers said.\n\nBesides downloading the .NET stealer, the second-stage stealer is equipped to steal Discord and Minecraft tokens, as well as Telegram-related data. The .NET stealer, on the other hand, is capable of harvesting credentials from various web browsers and gathering files, and information from cryptocurrency wallets and other apps like Steam, and FileZilla.\n\nIt can also take screenshots and amass information related to running processes, the system's external IP address, and clipboard contents. The captured information is eventually bundled and transmitted back to the attacker via a Discord webhook.\n\nThe campaign is suspected to be the work of a Russian-speaking threat actor owing to the presence of several artifacts written in the Russian language and the timezone of the attacker's commits (UTC+03:00). It's estimated that more than 1,500 devices may have fallen prey to the scheme.\n\n\"This case highlights how popular gaming communities can be exploited as effective vectors for malware distribution, emphasizing the importance of caution when downloading third-party content,\" the researchers said.\n\n\"The Stargazers Ghost Network has been actively distributing this malware, targeting Minecraft players seeking mods to enhance their gameplay. What appeared to be harmless downloads were, in fact, Java-based loaders that deployed two additional stealers, capable of exfiltrating credentials and other sensitive data.\"\n\nNew Variants of KimJongRAT Stealer Detected\n\nThe development comes as Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 detailed two new variants of an information stealer codenamed KimJongRAT that's likely connected to the same North Korean threat actor behind BabyShark and Stolen Pencil. KimJongRAT has been detected in the wild as far back as May 2013, delivered as a secondary payload in BabyShark attacks.\n\n\"One of the new variants uses a Portable Executable (PE) file and the other uses a PowerShell implementation,\" security researcher Dominik Reichel said. \"The PE and PowerShell variants are both initiated by clicking a Windows shortcut (LNK) file that downloads a dropper file from an attacker-controlled content delivery network (CDN) account.\"\n\nWhile the PE variant's dropper deploys a loader, a decoy PDF and a text file, the dropper in the PowerShell variant deploys a decoy PDF file along with a ZIP archive. The loader, in turn, downloads auxiliary payloads, including the stealer component for KimJongRAT.\n\nThe ZIP archive delivered by the PowerShell variant's dropper contains scripts that embed the KimJongRAT PowerShell-based stealer and keylogger components.\n\nBoth the new incarnations are capable of gathering and transferring victim information, files matching specific extensions, and browser data, such as credentials and details from cryptocurrency wallet extensions. The PE variant of KimJongRAT is also designed to harvest FTP and email client information.\n\n\"The continued development and deployment of KimJongRAT, featuring changing techniques such as using a legitimate CDN server to disguise its distribution, demonstrates a clear and ongoing threat,\" Unit 42 said. \"This adaptability not only showcases the persistent threat posed by such malware but also underscores its developers' commitment to updating and expanding its capabilities.\"",

Also employed are PowerShell scripts to weaken host defenses and inhibit system recovery.\n\nWater Curse has been described as a financially motivated threat actor that's driven by credential theft, session hijacking, and resale of illicit access. As many as 76 GitHub accounts have been linked to the campaign. There is evidence to suggest related activity may have been ongoing all the way back to March 2023.\n\nLeveraging GitHub as a malware distribution point is a tactic that has been adopted by several threat actors in the past. But the use of a network of GitHub accounts to create malicious repositories particularly overlaps with another distribution-as-service (DaaS) offering called the Stargazers Ghost Network.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Check Point Research told The Hacker News that it can \"neither deny nor confirm\" if these activities are part of the Stargazers Ghost Network given the limited information available. \"However, we've noticed that the <PreBuildEvent> attack method has been used in past campaigns distributed by the Stargazers Ghost Network,\" it said.\n\nThe emergence of Water Curse is the latest example of how threat actors are abusing the trust associated with legitimate platforms like GitHub as a delivery channel for malware and stage software supply chain attacks.\n\n\"Their repositories include malware, evasion utilities, game cheats, aimbots, cryptocurrency wallet tools, OSINT scrapers, spamming bots, and credential stealers,\" Trend Micro said. \"This reflects a multi-vertical targeting strategy that blends cybercrime with opportunistic monetization.\"\n\n\"Their infrastructure and behavior indicate a focus on stealth, automation, and scalability, with active exfiltration via Telegram and public file-sharing services.\"\n\nThe disclosure comes as multiple campaigns have been observed leveraging the prevalent ClickFix strategy to deploy various malware families such as AsyncRAT, DeerStealer (via a loader named Hijack Loader), Filch Stealer, LightPerlGirl, and SectopRAT (also via Hijack Loader).\n\nAsyncRAT is one of the many readily available remote access trojans (RATs) that has been put to use by unidentified threat actors to indiscriminately target thousands of organizations spanning multiple sectors since early 2024. Some aspects of the campaign were documented by Forcepoint in August 2024 and January 2025.\n\n\"This tradecraft allows the malware to bypass traditional perimeter defenses, particularly by using Cloudflare's temporary tunnels to serve payloads from seemingly legitimate infrastructure,\" Halcyon said. \"These tunnels provide attackers with ephemeral and unregistered subdomains that appear trustworthy to perimeter controls, making it difficult to pre-block or blacklist.\"\n\n\"Because the infrastructure is spun up dynamically via legitimate services, defenders face challenges in distinguishing malicious use from authorized DevOps or IT maintenance workflows. This tactic enables threat actors to deliver payloads without relying on compromised servers or bulletproof hosting, increasing both the scale and stealth of the campaign.\"\n\nThe findings also follow the discovery of an ongoing malicious campaign that has targeted various European organizations located in Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands with invoice-themed phishing lures to deliver a named Sorillus RAT (aka Ratty RAT).\n\nPrevious campaigns distributing the malware have singled out accounting and tax professionals using income tax return decoys, some of which have leveraged HTML smuggling techniques to conceal the malicious payloads.\n\nThe attack chain detailed by Orange Cyberdefense employs similar phishing emails that aim to trick recipients into opening PDF attachments containing a OneDrive link that points to a PDF file directly hosted on the cloud storage service while prompting the user to click an \"Open the document\" button.\n\nDoing so redirects the victim to a malicious web server that acts as a traffic distribution system (TDS) to evaluate the incoming request and determine whether they need to proceed further to the next stage of the infection. If the victim's machine meets the necessary criteria, they are displayed a benign PDF while a JAR file is stealthily downloaded to drop and execute Sorillus RAT.\n\nA Java-based RAT that first surfaced in 2019, Sorillus is a cross-platform malware that can harvest sensitive information, download/upload files, take screenshots, record audio, log keystrokes, run arbitrary commands, and even uninstall itself. It also doesn't help that numerous racked versions of the trojan are available online.\n\nThe attacks are assessed to be part of a broader campaign that has been observed delivering SambaSpy to users in Italy. SambaSpy, per Orange Cyberdefense, belongs to the Sorillus malware family.\n\n\"The operation showcases a strategic blend of legitimate services – such as OneDrive, MediaFire, and tunneling platforms like Ngrok and LocaltoNet – to evade detection,\" the cybersecurity company said. \"The repeated use of Brazilian Portuguese in payloads supports a likely attribution to Brazilian-speaking threat actors.\"",

It was resolved in version 24.7.1.380 released in September 2024.\n\n\"This group leverages zero-day exploits, which enables it to penetrate secure infrastructures more effectively,\" the researchers said. \"The group also creates and uses sophisticated malware, implying that it has a long-term strategy and intends to maintain persistence on the compromised systems for an extended period.\"",

    "full_content": "Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a now-patched security flaw in LangChain's LangSmith platform that could be exploited to capture sensitive data, including API keys and user prompts.\n\nThe vulnerability, which carries a CVSS score of 8.8 out of a maximum of 10.0, has been codenamed AgentSmith by Noma Security.\n\nLangSmith is an observability and evaluation platform that allows users to develop, test, and monitor large language model (LLM) applications, including those built using LangChain. The service also offers what's called a LangChain Hub, which acts as a repository for all publicly listed prompts, agents, and models.\n\n\"This newly identified vulnerability exploited unsuspecting users who adopt an agent containing a pre-configured malicious proxy server uploaded to 'Prompt Hub,'\" researchers Sasi Levi and Gal Moyal said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\n\"Once adopted, the malicious proxy discreetly intercepted all user communications – including sensitive data such as API keys (including OpenAI API Keys), user prompts, documents, images, and voice inputs – without the victim's knowledge.\"\n\nThe first phase of the attack essentially unfolds thus: A bad actor crafts an artificial intelligence (AI) agent and configures it with a model server under their control via the Proxy Provider feature, which allows the prompts to be tested against any model that is compliant with the OpenAI API. The attacker then shares the agent on LangChain Hub.\n\nThe next stage kicks in when a user finds this malicious agent via LangChain Hub and proceeds to \"Try It\" by providing a prompt as input. In doing so, all of their communications with the agent are stealthily routed through the attacker's proxy server, causing the data to be exfiltrated without the user's knowledge.\n\nThe captured data could include OpenAI API keys, prompt data, and any uploaded attachments. The threat actor could weaponize the OpenAI API key to gain unauthorized access to the victim's OpenAI environment, leading to more severe consequences, such as model theft and system prompt leakage.\n\nWhat's more, the attacker could use up all of the organization's API quota, driving up billing costs or temporarily restricting access to OpenAI services.\n\nIt doesn't end there. Should the victim opt to clone the agent into their enterprise environment, along with the embedded malicious proxy configuration, it risks continuously leaking valuable data to the attackers without giving any indication to them that their traffic is being intercepted.\n\nFollowing responsible disclosure on October 29, 2024, the vulnerability was addressed in the backend by LangChain as part of a fix deployed on November 6. In addition, the patch implements a warning prompt about data exposure when users attempt to clone an agent containing a custom proxy configuration.\n\n\"Beyond the immediate risk of unexpected financial losses from unauthorized API usage, malicious actors could gain persistent access to internal datasets uploaded to OpenAI, proprietary models, trade secrets and other intellectual property, resulting in legal liabilities and reputational damage,\" the researchers said.\n\nNew WormGPT Variants Detailed\n\nThe disclosure comes as Cato Networks revealed that threat actors have released two previously unreported WormGPT variants that are powered by xAI Grok and Mistral AI Mixtral.\n\nWormGPT launched in mid-2023 as an uncensored generative AI tool designed to expressly facilitate malicious activities for threat actors, such as creating tailored phishing emails and writing snippets of malware. The project shut down not long after the tool's author was outed as a 23-year-old Portuguese programmer.\n\nSince then several new \"WormGPT\" variants have been advertised on cybercrime forums like BreachForums, including xzin0vich-WormGPT and keanu-WormGPT, that are designed to provide \"uncensored responses to a wide range of topics\" even if they are \"unethical or illegal.\"\n\n\"'WormGPT' now serves as a recognizable brand for a new class of uncensored LLMs,\" security researcher Vitaly Simonovich said.\n\n\"These new iterations of WormGPT are not bespoke models built from the ground up, but rather the result of threat actors skillfully adapting existing LLMs. By manipulating system prompts and potentially employing fine-tuning on illicit data, the creators offer potent AI-driven tools for cybercriminal operations under the WormGPT brand.\"",
    "summary_gpt": "A security flaw in LangChain's LangSmith platform, dubbed AgentSmith, allowed attackers to intercept sensitive data like API keys and user prompts. The vulnerability had a CVSS score of 8.8 and was exploited by uploading a malicious proxy server to the Prompt Hub. Attackers could exfiltrate data without the victim's knowledge, potentially leading to unauthorized access, model theft, and increased billing costs. LangChain patched the vulnerability on November 6, 2024, and implemented a warning prompt for users cloning agents with custom proxy configurations.",

Alternate attack chains have been found to leverage an embedded image that, when clicked, downloads the malware.\n\nThe PDF files, in turn, contain a link that redirects prospective targets to a download page hosting a ZIP archive. Present within the file are several legitimate executables, shellcode loaders, and encrypted shellcode.\n\nThe multi-stage infection sequence entails the use of the shellcode loader to decrypt and execute the shellcode, which is nothing but DLL files sideloaded by the legitimate binaries using DLL side-loading techniques. Intermediate payloads deployed as part of the attack incorporate anti-VM and privilege escalation so as to ensure that the malware runs unimpeded on the compromised host.\n\nThe attack culminates with the execution of \"msgDb.dat,\" which implements command-and-control (C2) functions to collect user information and download additional modules to facilitate file management and remote desktop capabilities.\n\nFortinet said it also discovered the threat actor propagating Gh0stCringe via PDF attachments in phishing emails that take users to document download HTM pages.\n\n\"The attack chain comprises numerous snippets of shellcode and loaders, making the attack flow complex,\" the company said. \"Across winos, HoldingHands, and Gh0stCringe, this threat group continuously evolves its malware and distribution strategies.\"\n\nUpdate\n\nAccording to a security researcher, who goes by the handle somedieyoungZZ, the Silver Fox group has also targeted organizations in Japan and Taiwan using digitally-signed fake salary revision notices. These executables, signed with stolen certificates, unpack COM-based loaders and deploy backdoors in memory to establish persistent remote access.\n\n\"From leveraging a stolen digital certificate to delivering modular payloads, the entire setup is crafted to bypass conventional detection mechanisms,\" the researcher said. \"The fact that the payload is decrypted at runtime adds an extra layer of friction for any form of static analysis.\"",

Users are likely not impacted if they were previously running a version prior to 10.1 and then upgraded to a newer vulnerable version, assuming the old database is being migrated, and not the database embedded within the installation package.\n\nWith previously disclosed flaws in Sitecore XP coming under active exploitation in the wild (CVE-2019-9874 and CVE-2019-9875), it's essential that users apply the latest patches, if not already, to safeguard against potential cyber threats.\n\n\"By default, recent versions of Sitecore shipped with a user that had a hard-coded password of 'b.' It's 2025, and we can't believe we still have to say this, but that's very bad,\" Benjamin Harris, CEO and founder of watchTowr, told The Hacker News in a statement.\n\n\"Sitecore is deployed across thousands of environments, including banks, airlines, and global enterprises – so the blast radius here is massive. And no, this isn't theoretical: we've run the full chain, end-to-end. If you're running Sitecore, it doesn't get worse than this – rotate creds and patch immediately before attackers inevitably reverse engineer the fix.\"\n\nUpdate\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Sitecore spokesperson shared the following statement with The Hacker News: \"We are aware of the recent report from watchTowr identifying several vulnerabilities in our software. We have actively collaborated with them to address the issue and have published a Knowledge Base article with details of patches and steps to remediate.\"\n\nThe company also pointed out it has remediated a previous finding from watchTowr in February 2025 (CVE-2025-27218, CVSS score: 5.3), which it said had been fixed in December 2024.\n\n\"Our customer support teams have proactively communicated these updates to our affected clients.

It was patched by Langflow in March 2025 with version 1.3.0.\n\nLast month, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) flagged the active exploitation of CVE-2025-3248 in the wild, with the SANS Technology Institute revealing that it detected exploit attempts against its honeypot servers.\n\nThe latest findings from Trend Micro show that threat actors are targeting unpatched internet-exposed Langflow instances leveraging a publicly-available proof-of-concept (PoC) code to conduct reconnaissance and drop a shell script downloader responsible for retrieving and executing the Flodrix botnet malware from \"80.66.75[.]121:25565.\"\n\nOnce installed, Flodrix sets up communications with a remote server to receive commands over TCP in order to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against target IP addresses of interest. The botnet also supports connections over the TOR anonymity network.\n\n\"Since Langflow does not enforce input validation or sandboxing, these payloads are compiled and executed within the server's context, leading to [remote code execution],\" the researchers said. \"Based on these steps, the attacker is likely profiling all vulnerable servers and uses the collected data to identify high-value targets for future infections.\"\n\nTrend Micro said it identified the unknown threat actors to be hosting different downloader scripts on the same host used to fetch Flodrix, suggesting that the campaign is undergoing active development.\n\nFlodrix is assessed to be an evolution of another botnet called LeetHozer that's linked to the Moobot group. The improved variant incorporates the ability to discreetly remove itself, minimize forensic traces, and complicate analysis efforts by obfuscating command-and-control (C2) server addresses and other important indicators.\n\n\"Another significant change is the introduction of new DDoS attack types, which are now also encrypted, adding a further layer of obfuscation,\" Trend Micro said. \"The new sample also notably enumerates the running processes by opening /proc directory to access all running processes.\"\n\nUpdate\n\nIn a follow-up analysis, Censys said it discovered a misconfiguration on the command-and-control (C2) server used by the Flodrix botnet (80.66.75[.]121) to await DDoS attack commands.\n\n\"The botnet's C2 server exposed a portmapper and an NFS (Network File System) share, allowing us to identify 745 compromised hosts,\" the attack surface management platform said, adding it also detected Arm-focused malware binaries and shell scripts on the remote file share.\n\nThe vast majority of the infections are located in Taiwan, with 540 infected devices, followed by the United States with 17. Nearly 50% of the compromised systems are assessed to be internet-connected cameras.\n\n(The story was updated after publication to include additional information shared by Censys.)",

Bai, Head of the Justice Department's National Security Division.\n\nThe Justice Department said the funds were originally restrained in connection with an April 2023 indictment against Sim Hyon-Sop, a North Korean Foreign Trade Bank (FTB) representative who is believed to have conspired with the IT workers.\n\nThe IT workers, the department added, gained employment at U.S. cryptocurrency companies using fake identities and then laundered their ill-gotten gains through Sim to further Pyongyang's strategic objectives in violation of the sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the United Nations.\n\nThe fraudulent scheme has evolved into a massive operation since its origins way back in 2017. The illegal employment operation leverages a combination of stolen and fictitious identities, aided with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) tools like OpenAI ChatGPT, to bypass due diligence checks and secure freelance jobs.\n\nTracked under the monikers Wagemole and UNC5267, the activity is assessed to be affiliated with the Workers' Party of Korea and is viewed as a methodically engineered strategy to embed IT workers inside legitimate companies to draw a steady source of revenue for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).\n\nBesides misrepresenting identities and locations, a core aspect of the operation involves recruiting facilitators to run laptop farms across the world, enable video interview stages, as well as launder the proceeds back through various accounts.\n\nOne such laptop farm facilitator was Christina Marie Chapman, who pleaded guilty earlier this February for her involvement in the illicit revenue regeneration scheme. In a report published last month, The Wall Street Journal revealed how a LinkedIn message in March 2020 drew Chapman, a former waitress and massage therapist with over 100,000 followers on TikTok, into the intricate scam. She is scheduled to be sentenced on July 16.\n\n\"After laundering these funds, the North Korean IT workers allegedly sent them back to the North Korean government, at times via Sim and Kim Sang Man,\" the DoJ said. \"Kim is a North Korean national who is the chief executive officer of 'Chinyong,' also known as 'Jinyong IT Cooperation Company.'\"\n\nAn analysis of Sim's cryptocurrency wallet by TRM Labs has revealed that it has received more than $24 million in cryptocurrency from August 2021 to March 2023.\n\nNorth Korea Organizational assessment\n\n\"Most of these funds were traced back to Kim's accounts, which were opened using forged Russian identity documents and accessed from Korean-language devices operating from the U.A.E. and Russia,\" TRM Labs said. \"Sim, a North Korean official, operated out of Dubai and maintained a self-hosted wallet that received laundered funds from dozens of sources.\"\n\nKim, from his base in Vladivostok, Russia, acted as an intermediary between the IT workers and FTB, using two accounts to collect funds from them and re-distribute the proceeds to Sim and to other wallets connected to North Korea.\n\nCybersecurity company DTEX has characterized the IT worker threat as a state-sponsored crime syndicate that's mainly geared towards sanctions evasion and generating profits, with the threat actors gradually shifting from laptop farms to using their own machines as part of companies' Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies.\n\n\"Opportunity is really their only tactic and everything is treated as a tool of some sort,\" Michael Barnhart, DTEX Principal i3 Insider Risk Investigator at DTEX Systems, told The Hacker News.\n\n\"If the focus is on laptop farms, which has been very good in getting that word out there, then naturally this opportunistic nation wants to gravitate to where the path is much easier if it is impacting operations. Until laptop farms are no longer effective at all, then that will still be an option, but abuse of BYOD was something that DTEX had seen in investigations and wasn't publicized as much as the farms were.\"\n\nDTEX further pointed out that these IT workers could fall under either of the two categories: Revenue IT workers (R-ITW) or malicious IT workers (M-ITW), each of which has their own function within North Korea's cyber structure.\n\nWhile R-ITW personnel are said to be less privileged and primarily motivated to make money for the regime, M-ITW actors go beyond revenue generation by extorting a victim client, sabotaging a cryptocurrency server, stealing valuable intellectual property, or executing malicious code in an environment.\n\nChinyong, per the insider risk management firm, is one of the many IT companies that has deployed its workers for conducting a combination of freelance IT work and cryptocurrency theft by leveraging their insider access to blockchain projects. It operates out of China, Laos, and Russia.\n\nTwo individuals associated with Chinyong-related IT worker efforts have been unmasked as having used the personas Naoki Murano and Jenson Collins to raise funds for North Korea, with Murano previously linked to a $6 million heist at crypto firm DeltaPrime in September 2024.\n\n\"Ultimately, the detection of DPRK-linked laptop farms and remote worker schemes requires defenders to look beyond traditional indicators of compromise and start asking different questions – about infrastructure, behavior, and access,\" security researcher Matt Ryan said. \"These campaigns aren't just about malware or phishing; they're about deception at scale, often executed in ways that blend seamlessly with legitimate remote work.\"\n\nFurther investigation into the sprawling multi-million dollar fraud has uncovered several accounts tied to fake domains set up for the various front companies used to provide phony references for the IT workers. These accounts were infected with information-stealing malware, Flashpoint noted, enabling it to flag some aspects of their tradecraft.\n\nThe company said it identified a compromised host located in Lahore, Pakistan, that contained a saved credential for an email account that was used as a point of contact when registering the domains associated with Baby Box Info, Helix US, and Cubix Tech US.\n\nOn top of that, browser history captured by the stealer malware in another instance has uncloaked Google Translate URLs related to dozens of translations between English and Korean, including those related to providing falsified job references and shipping electronic devices.\n\nThat's not all. Recent research has also laid bare a \"covert, multi-layered remote-control system\" used by North Korean IT workers to establish persistent access to company-issued laptops in a laptop farm while being physically located in Asia.\n\n\"The operation leveraged a combination of low-level protocol signaling and legitimate collaboration tools to maintain remote access and enable data visibility and control using Zoom,\" Sygnia said in a report published in April 2025. \"The attack chain [...] involved the abuse of ARP packets to trigger event-based actions, a custom WebSocket-based command-and-control (C2) channel, and automation of Zoom's remote-control features.\"\n\n\"To further enhance stealth and automation, specific Zoom client configurations were required. Settings were meticulously adjusted to prevent user-facing indicators and audio-visual disturbances. Users were persistently signed in, video and audio were automatically muted upon joining, participant names were hidden, screen sharing initiated without visible indicators, and preview windows disabled.\"\n\nRyan has theorized that the Zoom remote control system is likely used in conjunction with low-cost Raspberry Pi Zeros for C2 on the laptop farm's local area network (LAN) to achieve remote access at scale and simulate real user interaction across dozens of devices.\n\nRunning complementary to Wagemole is another campaign referred to as Contagious Interview (aka DeceptiveDevelopment, Famous Chollima, Gwisin Gang, Tenacious Pungsan, UNC5342, and Void Dokkaebi) which primarily conducts malicious activity targeting developers to gain unauthorized company access as opposed to gaining employment.\n\n\"Gwisin Gang frankly are IT workers that instead of taking the long process of applying for a job, they target someone who already had the job,\" Barnhart said. \"They do appear elevated and unique in that they have malware usage that echoes this notion as well. IT workers is an overarching term though and there are many styles, varieties, and skill levels amongst them.\"\n\nAs for how the IT worker scheme could evolve in the coming years, Barnhart points to the traditional financial sector as the target.\n\n\"With the implementation of blockchain and Web3 technologies into traditional financial institutions, I think all the DPRK cyber assets in that space are going to be aiming to have a run on these companies the way it was happening in years past,\" Barnhart pointed out. \"The more we integrate with those technologies, the more careful we have to be as DPRK is very entrenched.\"",

On the other hand, data extortion and access monetization schemes offer a 60-40 and 50-50 split, respectively.\n\nAttack chains mounted by Anubis involve the use of phishing emails as the initial access vector, with the threat actors leveraging the foothold to escalate privileges, conduct reconnaissance, and take steps to delete volume shadow copies, before encrypting files and, if necessary, wipe their contents.\n\nThis means that the file sizes are reduced to 0 KB while leaving the file names or their extensions untouched, making recovery impossible and, therefore, exerting more pressure on victims to pay up.\n\n\"The ransomware includes a wiper feature using /WIPEMODE parameter, which can permanently delete the contents of a file, preventing any recovery attempt,\" the researchers said.\n\n\"Its ability to both encrypt and permanently destroy data significantly raises the stakes for victims, amplifying the pressure to comply -- just as strong ransomware operations aim to do.\"\n\nThe discovery of Anubis' destructive behavior comes as Recorded Future detailed new infrastructure associated with the FIN7 group that's being used to impersonate legitimate software products and services as part of a campaign designed to deliver NetSupport RAT.\n\nThe Mastercard-owned threat intelligence firm said it identified three unique distribution vectors over the past year that have employed bogus browser update pages, fake 7-Zip download sites, and TAG-124 (aka 404 TDS, Chaya_002, Kongtuke, and LandUpdate808) to deliver the malware.\n\nWhile the fake browser update method loads a custom loader dubbed MaskBat to execute the remote access trojan, the remaining two infection vectors employ another custom PowerShell loader dubbed PowerNet that decompresses and executes it.\n\n\"[MaskBat] has similarities to FakeBat but is obfuscated and contains strings linked to GrayAlpha,\" Recorded Future's Insikt Group said. \"Although all three infection vectors were observed being used simultaneously, only the fake 7-Zip download pages were still active at the time of writing, with newly registered domains appearing as recently as April 2025.\"",

Zero-Click AI Flaw Allows Data Exfiltration Without User Interaction — The first known zero-click artificial intelligence vulnerability in Microsoft 365 could have allowed attackers to exfiltrate sensitive internal data without any user interaction. The flaw, dubbed EchoLeak, involved what's described as an LLM Scope Violation, referring to scenarios where a large language model (LLM) can be manipulated into leaking information beyond its intended context. In this case, an attacker can craft a malicious email containing specific markdown syntax that could slip past Microsoft's Cross-Prompt Injection Attack (XPIA) defenses, causing the AI assistant to process the malicious payload and exfiltrate data using Microsoft's own trusted domains, including SharePoint and Teams, which are allowlisted under Copilot's content security policies. These domains can be used to embed external links or images that, when rendered by Copilot, automatically issue outbound requests to redirect stolen data to an attacker-controlled server. The most important aspect of this attack is that it all happens behind the scenes and users don't even have to open the email message or click on any link. All it requires is for a victim to ask Microsoft 365 Copilot a business-related question that triggers the whole attack chain automatically. Microsoft, which is tracking the issue as CVE-2025-32711, has resolved it and emphasized it found no evidence of the vulnerability being exploited in the wild.\n\n— The first known zero-click artificial intelligence vulnerability in Microsoft 365 could have allowed attackers to exfiltrate sensitive internal data without any user interaction.

VexTrio Runs a Massive Affiliate Program to Propagate Malware, Scams — The threat actors behind the VexTrio Viper Traffic Distribution Service (TDS) have been linked to a far-reaching campaign that hijacks WordPress sites to funnel victims into malware and scam networks. The malicious operation is designed to monetize compromised infrastructure, transforming legitimate websites into unwitting participants in a massive criminal advertising ecosystem. The scale of VexTrio's activities came to light in November 2024 when Qurium revealed that Los Pollos, a Swiss-Czech adtech company, was part of the illicit TDS scheme. A new analysis from Infoblox has found that Los Pollos is one of the many companies controlled by VexTrio, including Taco Loco and Adtrafico, each overseeing different functions within the commercial affiliate network. These companies are in charge of recruiting publishing affiliates, who compromise websites with JavaScript injects, and advertising affiliates, who are the operators behind scams, malware, and other forms of fraud, turning VexTrio into an Uber-like intermediary for a criminal model that has generated substantial profits for the enterprise. Furthermore, when Los Pollos announced the cessation of their push monetization services in November 2024, many of these malware operations simultaneously migrated to TDSs called Help TDS and Disposable TDS, which are one and the same, and enjoyed an \"exclusive relationship with VexTrio\" until around the same time.\n\n‎️‍🔥 Trending CVEs\n\nAttackers love software vulnerabilities – they're easy doors into your systems.

Meta and Yandex Caught Using Tracking Code to Leak Unique Identifiers to Installed Native Apps on Android — Meta and Yandex misused Android's localhost ports to stealthily pass tracking data from mobile browsers into native apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Yandex services. This behavior allowed them to bypass browser sandboxing and Android's permission system, likely making it possible to attach persistent identifiers to detailed browsing histories. The tracking worked even in private browsing modes across major browsers like Chrome and Firefox. Put differently, the loophole lets the apps detect any websites that Android device users visit and integrate the tracking scripts, and gather web cookie data via the device's loopback interface. It takes advantage of the fact that the Android operating system allows any installed app with the INTERNET permission to open a listening socket on localhost (127.0.0.1) and browsers running on the same device can also access this interface without user consent or platform mediation. This opens the door to a scenario where JavaScript embedded on web pages can communicate with native Android apps and share identifiers and browsing habits over standard Web APIs. Evidence of Meta using the technique first emerged in September 2024, but Yandex is said to have adopted the technique in February 2017. Meta Pixel is embedded on over 6 million websites, while Yandex Metrica is present on close to 3 million websites. \"These native Android apps receive browsers' metadata, cookies, and commands from the Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica scripts embedded on thousands of websites,\" a group of academics from IMDEA Networks, Radboud University, and KU Leuven said. \"These JavaScripts load on users' mobile browsers and silently connect with native apps running on the same device through localhost sockets. As native apps access programmatically device identifiers like the Android Advertising ID (AAID) or handle user identities as in the case of Meta apps, this method effectively allows these organizations to link mobile browsing sessions and web cookies to user identities, hence de-anonymizing users' visiting sites embedding their scripts.\" As of June 3, 2025, the Meta/Facebook Pixel script is no longer sending any packets or requests to localhost, and the code responsible for sending _fbp cookie has been removed. Yandex claimed the feature in question did not collect any sensitive information and was solely meant to improve personalization. However, it has discontinued its use, citing privacy concerns. Google and Mozilla have released countermeasures to plug the eavesdropping scheme.\n\n— Meta and Yandex misused Android's localhost ports to stealthily pass tracking data from mobile browsers into native apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Yandex services. This behavior allowed them to bypass browser sandboxing and Android's permission system, likely making it possible to attach persistent identifiers to detailed browsing histories. The tracking worked even in private browsing modes across major browsers like Chrome and Firefox. Put differently, the loophole lets the apps detect any websites that Android device users visit and integrate the tracking scripts, and gather web cookie data via the device's loopback interface. It takes advantage of the fact that the Android operating system allows any installed app with the INTERNET permission to open a listening socket on localhost (127.0.0.1) and browsers running on the same device can also access this interface without user consent or platform mediation. This opens the door to a scenario where JavaScript embedded on web pages can communicate with native Android apps and share identifiers and browsing habits over standard Web APIs.

Replay Attacks as a Way to Bypass Deepfake Detection — New research has found that replay attacks are an effective method to bypass deepfake detection. \"By playing and re-recording deepfake audio through various speakers and microphones, we make spoofed samples appear authentic to the detection model,\" a team of researchers said. The development heralds new cyber risks as voice cloning technology has become a major driver of vishing attacks, allowing attackers to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to generate synthetic audio that impersonate executives or IT personnel in an effort to gain privileged access to corporate systems.\n\n— New research has found that replay attacks are an effective method to bypass deepfake detection. \"By playing and re-recording deepfake audio through various speakers and microphones, we make spoofed samples appear authentic to the detection model,\" a team of researchers said.

Linux Malware Families Receive Steady Code Updates — A new analysis of known Linux malware such as NoodleRAT, Winnti, SSHdInjector, Pygmy Goat, and AcidRain has found that \"they had at least two significant code updates within the last year, meaning threat actors are actively updating and supporting them,\" Palo Alto Networks unit 42 said. \"Additionally, each of the malware strains accounted for at least 20 unique sightings of samples in the wild over the last year. This means that threat actors are actively using them.\" The activities indicate that these malware families are highly likely to be used in future attacks aimed at cloud environments.\n\n— A new analysis of known Linux malware such as NoodleRAT, Winnti, SSHdInjector, Pygmy Goat, and AcidRain has found that \"they had at least two significant code updates within the last year, meaning threat actors are actively updating and supporting them,\" Palo Alto Networks unit 42 said. \"Additionally, each of the malware strains accounted for at least 20 unique sightings of samples in the wild over the last year.

Microsoft Defender Flaw Disclosed — Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a now-patched security flaw in Microsoft Defender for Identity that allows an unauthorized attacker to perform spoofing over an adjacent network by taking advantage of an improper authentication bug. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-26685 (CVSS score: 6.5), was patched by Microsoft in May 2025. NetSPI, which discovered and reported the flaw, said the issue \"abused the Lateral Movement Paths (LMPs) feature and allowed an unauthenticated attacker on the local network to coerce and capture the Net-NTLM hash of the associated Directory Service Account (DSA), under specific conditions.\" Once the Net-NTLM hash is captured, it can be taken offline for password cracking using tools like Hashcat or exploited in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to elevate privileges to the DSA account and obtain a foothold in the Active Directory environment.\n\n— Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a now-patched security flaw in Microsoft Defender for Identity that allows an unauthorized attacker to perform spoofing over an adjacent network by taking advantage of an improper authentication bug.

Apple Updates Passwords App with New Features — Apple has previewed new features in its Passwords app with iOS 26 and macOS 26 Tahoe that allow users to view the complete version history for stored logins, including the timestamps when a particular password was saved or changed. Another useful addition is the ability to import and export passkeys between participating credential manager apps across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and visionOS 26. \"This user-initiated process, secured by local authentication like Face ID, reduces the risk of credential leaks,\" Apple said. \"The transfer uses a standardized data schema developed by the FIDO Alliance, ensuring compatibility between apps.\" A similar feature is already in the works for Google Password Manager. Last October, the FIDO Alliance unveiled the Credential Exchange Protocol (CXP) and Credential Exchange Format (CXF) to facilitate interoperability.\n\n— Apple has previewed new features in its Passwords app with iOS 26 and macOS 26 Tahoe that allow users to view the complete version history for stored logins, including the timestamps when a particular password was saved or changed.

CyberEYE RAT Exposed — Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on the inner workings of CyberEYE RAT (aka TelegramRAT, a modular, .NET-based trojan that provides surveillance and data theft capabilities. Its various modules harvest browser history and passwords, Wi-Fi passwords, gaming profiles, files matching configured extensions, FileZilla FPT credentials, and session data from applications like Telegram and Discord. \"Its use of Telegram for Command and Control (C2) eliminates the need for attackers to maintain their own infrastructure, making it more evasive and accessible,\" CYFIRMA said. \"The malware is deployed through a builder GUI that allows attackers to customize payloads by injecting credentials, modifying metadata, and bundling features such as keyloggers, file grabbers, clipboard hijackers, and persistence mechanisms.\" The malware also acts as a clipper to redirect cryptocurrency transactions and employs defense evasion techniques by disabling Windows Defender through PowerShell and registry manipulations.\n\n— Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on the inner workings of CyberEYE RAT (aka TelegramRAT, a modular, .NET-based trojan that provides surveillance and data theft capabilities.

WhatsApp Joins Apple's Encryption Fight With U.K. — Meta-owned WhatsApp said it's backing Apple in its legal fight against the U.K. Home Office's demands for backdoor access to encrypted iCloud data worldwide under the Investigatory Powers Act. The move, the company told BBC, \"could set a dangerous precedent\" by \"emboldening\" other nations to put forth similar requests to break encryption. In response to the government notice, Apple pulled the Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature for iCloud from U.K. users' devices and took legal action to appeal to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal to overturn the secret Technical Capability Notice (TCN) issued by the Home Office. In April 2025, the tribunal ruled the details of the legal row cannot be kept secret. The existence of the TCN was first reported by The Washington Post in January. Governments across the U.S., U.K., and the European Union (E.U.) have sought to push back against end-to-end encryption, arguing it enables criminals, terrorists, and sex offenders to conceal illicit activity. Europol, in its 2025 Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA) released last week, said: \"While encryption protects users' privacy, the criminal abuse of end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) apps is increasingly hampering investigations. Cybercriminals hide behind anonymity while coordinating sales of stolen data, often with no visibility for investigators.\"\n\n— Meta-owned WhatsApp said it's backing Apple in its legal fight against the U.K. Home Office's demands for backdoor access to encrypted iCloud data worldwide under the Investigatory Powers Act.

According to Zscaler ThreatLabz, a bug introduced in its C2 server in June 2022 inadvertently caused it to \"leak snippets of its process memory in responses to infected victims,\" giving more visibility into the malware. The leaked information included threat actor usernames, threat actor IP addresses, backend C2 server IP addresses and domains, infection and exfiltration statistics, malware version updates, private cryptographic keys, victim IP addresses, victim credentials, and other exfiltrated victim data. The June 2022 update introduced a new C2 protocol to exchange command data and responses. \"The memory leak allowed up to 1,792 bytes per C2 server response to be exposed,\" Zscaler said. \"The content of the leaked data was arbitrary and depended on the code being executed and the data being manipulated in the C2 server process at a given time.\"\n\n— Last month, a coordinated law enforcement operation felled DanaBot, a Delphi malware that allowed its operators to remotely commandeer the infected machines, steal data, and deliver additional payloads like ransomware.

Cyber Partisans Targets Belarus and Russia — A Belarusian hacktivist group called Cyber Partisans has been observed targeting industrial enterprises and government agencies in Russia and Belarus with a backdoor known as Vasilek that uses Telegram for C2 and data exfiltration. The phishing attacks are notable for the deployment of another backdoor called DNSCat2 that enables attackers to remotely manage an infected system and a wiper referred to as Pryanik. \"The first thing that draws attention is that the viper acts as a logic bomb: its functionality is activated on a certain date and time,\" Kaspersky said. Other tools used as part of the attacks include Gost for proxying and tunneling network traffic, and Evlx for removing events from Windows event logs. In a statement to Recorded Future News, the collective stated that Kaspersky's attention to its operations may have stemmed from the fact that the attacks relied on the company's products and had failed to prevent intrusions. \"Such attacks make Kaspersky's technologies appear outdated, and perhaps this is why they are trying to justify themselves or counter us with these publications,\" the group was quoted as saying.\n\n— A Belarusian hacktivist group called Cyber Partisans has been observed targeting industrial enterprises and government agencies in Russia and Belarus with a backdoor known as Vasilek that uses Telegram for C2 and data exfiltration.

Singh and Ceraolo have been sentenced to 27 and 25 months' imprisonment respectively for conspiracy to commit computer intrusion and aggravated identity theft. \"Singh and Ceraolo unlawfully used a law enforcement officer's stolen password to access a nonpublic, password-protected web portal (the 'Portal') maintained by a U.S. federal law enforcement agency for the purpose of sharing intelligence with state and local law enforcement,\" the DoJ said. \"The defendants used their access to the Portal to extort their victims.\" The sentencing came as five men pleaded guilty for their involvement in laundering more than $36.9 million from victims of an international digital asset investment scam conspiracy (aka romance baiting) that was carried out from scam centers in Cambodia. The defendants include Joseph Wong, 33, of Alhambra, California; Yicheng Zhang, 39, of China; Jose Somarriba, 55, of Los Angeles; Shengsheng He, 39, of La Puente, California; and Jingliang Su, 44, of China and Turkey. They are said to be \"part of an international criminal network that induced U.S. victims, believing they were investing in digital assets, to transfer funds to accounts controlled by co-conspirators and that laundered victim money through U.S. shell companies, international bank accounts, and digital asset wallets.\" So far, eight people have pleaded guilty to participating in the criminal scheme, counting Chinese nationals Daren Li and Yicheng Zhang.\n\n— The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announced the sentencing of two members of the ViLE hacking group – Sagar Steven Singh, 21, and Nicholas Ceraolo, 27, – nearly a year after they pleaded guilty to aggravated identity theft and computer hacking crimes.

Kimsuky Targets Facebook, email, and Telegram Users in South Korea — The North Korean-affiliated threat actor known as Kimusky targeted Facebook, email, and Telegram users in its southern counterpart between March and April 2025 as part of a campaign codenamed Triple Combo. \"The threat actor used an account named 'Transitional Justice Mission' to send friend requests and direct messages to multiple individuals involved in North Korea-related activities,\" Genians said. \"The attacker also hijacked another Facebook account for their operation.\" Subsequently, the attackers attempted to approach the targets via email by using the email address obtained through Facebook Messenger conversations. Alternately, the Kimsuky actors leveraged the victims' phone numbers to contact them again via Telegram. Regardless of the channel used, these trust-building exercises triggered a multi-stage infection sequence to deliver a known malware called AppleSeed.\n\n🎥 Cybersecurity Webinars\n\nAI Agents Are Leaking Data — Learn How to Fix It Fast ➝ AI tools often connect to platforms like Google Drive and SharePoint—but without the right settings, they can accidentally expose sensitive data.

One method gaining attention is localhost tracking: apps like Facebook and Instagram silently run a web server inside your phone. When you visit a website with a hidden code, it can ping this server to see if the app is installed—leaking your activity back to the app, without your permission.\n\nAnother trick is port probing. Some websites scan your device to check if developer tools or apps are running on certain ports (like 3000 or 9222). This reveals what software you use or whether you're running a specific company's tool—leaking clues about your job, device, or activity. Sites may even detect browser extensions this way.\n\nOn mobile, some websites silently test if apps like Twitter, PayPal, or your banking app are installed by triggering invisible deep links. If the app opens or responds, they learn what apps you use. That's often used for profiling or targeted phishing. Also, browser cache abuse (using things like ETags or service workers) can fingerprint your browser—even across private tabs—keeping you identifiable even when you think you're clean.\n\nHow to protect yourself:\n\nUninstall apps you rarely use, especially ones from big platforms.\n\nUse browsers like Firefox with uBlock Origin and enable \"Block outsider intrusion into LAN.\"\n\nOn mobile, use hardened browsers like Bromite or Firefox Focus, and block background data for apps using tools like NetGuard.\n\nClear browser storage often, and use temporary containers or incognito containers to isolate sessions.\n\nThese aren't tinfoil hat ideas—they're real-world methods used by major tech firms and trackers today. Staying private means going beyond ad blockers and learning how the web really works behind the scenes.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat goes undetected often isn't invisible—it's just misclassified, minimized, or misunderstood. Human error isn't always a technical failure. Sometimes it's a story we tell ourselves about what shouldn't happen.\n\nReview your recent alerts. Which ones were ignored because they didn't \"feel right\" for the threat profile? The cost of dismissal is rising—especially when adversaries bank on it.",

The exact nature of the payload is unknown.\n\n\"It implements a multi-stage remote code execution attack using a transitive dependency to hide the malicious code,\" SafeDep researcher Kunal Singh said.\n\nSolders, on the other hand, has been found to incorporate a post-install script in its package.json, causing the malicious code to be automatically executed as soon as the package is installed.\n\n\"At first glance, it's hard to believe that this is actually valid JavaScript,\" the Veracode Threat Research team said. \"It looks like a seemingly random collection of Japanese symbols. It turns out that this particular obfuscation scheme uses the Unicode characters as variable names and a sophisticated chain of dynamic code generation to work.\"\n\nDecoding the script reveals an extra layer of obfuscation, unpacking which reveals its main function: Check if the compromised machine is Windows, and if so, run a PowerShell command to retrieve a next-stage payload from a remote server (\"firewall[.]tel\").\n\nThis second-stage PowerShell script, also obscured, is designed to fetch a Windows batch script from another domain (\"cdn.audiowave[.]org\") and configures a Windows Defender Antivirus exclusion list to avoid detection. The batch script then paves the way for the execution of a .NET DLL that reaches out to a PNG image hosted on ImgBB (\"i.ibb[.]co\").\n\n\"[The DLL] is grabbing the last two pixels from this image and then looping through some data contained elsewhere in it,\" Veracode said. \"It ultimately builds up in memory YET ANOTHER .NET DLL.\"\n\nFurthermore, the DLL is equipped to create task scheduler entries and features the ability to bypass user account control (UAC) using a combination of FodHelper.exe and programmatic identifiers (ProgIDs) to evade defenses and avoid triggering any security alerts to the user.\n\nThe newly-downloaded DLL is Pulsar RAT, a \"free, open-source Remote Administration Tool for Windows\" and a variant of the Quasar RAT malware.\n\n\"From a wall of Japanese characters to a RAT hidden within the pixels of a PNG file, the attacker went to extraordinary lengths to conceal their payload, nesting it a dozen layers deep to evade detection,\" Veracode said. \"While the attacker's ultimate objective for deploying the Pulsar RAT remains unclear, the sheer complexity of this delivery mechanism is a powerful indicator of malicious intent.\"\n\nCrypto Malware in the Open-Source Supply Chain\n\nThe findings also coincide with a report from Socket that identified credential stealers, cryptocurrency drainers, cryptojackers, and clippers as the main types of threats targeting the cryptocurrency and blockchain development ecosystem.\n\nSome of the examples of these packages include -\n\nexpress-dompurify and pumptoolforvolumeandcomment, which are capable of harvesting browser credentials and cryptocurrency wallet keys\n\nbs58js, which drains a victim's wallet and uses multi-hop transfers to obscure theft and frustrate forensic tracing.\n\nlsjglsjdv, asyncaiosignal, and raydium-sdk-liquidity-init, which functions as a clipper to monitor the system clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet strings and replace them with threat actor‑controlled addresses to reroute transactions to the attackers\n\n\"As Web3 development converges with mainstream software engineering, the attack surface for blockchain-focused projects is expanding in both scale and complexity,\" Socket security researcher Kirill Boychenko said.\n\n\"Financially motivated threat actors and state-sponsored groups are rapidly evolving their tactics to exploit systemic weaknesses in the software supply chain. These campaigns are iterative, persistent, and increasingly tailored to high-value targets.\"\n\nAI and Slopsquatting\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted coding, also called vibe coding, has unleashed another novel threat in the form of slopsquatting, where large language models (LLMs) can hallucinate non-existent but plausible package names that bad actors can weaponize to conduct supply chain attacks.\n\nTrend Micro, in a report last week, said it observed an unnamed advanced agent \"confidently\" cooking up a phantom Python package named starlette-reverse-proxy, only for the build process to crash with the error \"module not found.\" However, should an adversary upload a package with the same name on the repository, it can have serious security consequences.\n\nFurthermore, the cybersecurity company noted that advanced coding agents and workflows such as Claude Code CLI, OpenAI Codex CLI, and Cursor AI with Model Context Protocol (MCP)-backed validation can help reduce, but not completely eliminate, the risk of slopsquatting.\n\n\"When agents hallucinate dependencies or install unverified packages, they create an opportunity for slopsquatting attacks, in which malicious actors pre-register those same hallucinated names on public registries,\" security researcher Sean Park said.\n\n\"While reasoning-enhanced agents can reduce the rate of phantom suggestions by approximately half, they do not eliminate them entirely. Even the vibe-coding workflow augmented with live MCP validations achieves the lowest rates of slip-through, but still misses edge cases.\"\n\nchimera-sandbox-extensions Published as a Red Teaming Exercise\n\nLastly, a new package discovered on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository with capabilities to capture sensitive developer-related information, such as credentials, configuration data, and environment variables, has been identified as a red teaming effort.\n\nThe package, named chimera-sandbox-extensions, attracted 143 downloads and likely targeted users of a service called Chimera Sandbox, which was released by Singaporean tech company Grab last August to facilitate \"experimentation and development of [machine learning] solutions.\"\n\nThe package masquerades as a helper module for Chimera Sandbox, but \"aims to steal credentials and other sensitive information such as Jamf configuration, CI/CD environment variables, AWS tokens, and more,\" JFrog security researcher Guy Korolevski said in a report published last week.\n\nOnce installed, it attempts to connect to an external domain whose domain name is generated using a domain generation algorithm (DGA) in order to download and execute a next-stage payload.\n\nSpecifically, the malware acquires from the domain an authentication token, which is then used to send a request to the same domain and retrieve the Python-based information stealer.\n\nThe stealer is equipped to siphon a wide range of data from infected machines. This includes -\n\nJAMF receipts, which are records of software packages installed by Jamf Pro on managed computers\n\nPod sandbox environment authentication tokens and git information\n\nCI/CD information from environment variables\n\nZscaler host configuration\n\nAmazon Web Services account information and tokens\n\nPublic IP address\n\nGeneral platform, user, and host information\n\nThe kind of data gathered by the malware shows that it's mainly geared towards corporate and cloud infrastructure. In addition, the extraction of JAMF receipts indicates that it's also capable of targeting Apple macOS systems.\n\nThe collected information is sent via a POST request back to the same domain, after which the server assesses if the machine is a worthy target for further exploitation. However, JFrog said it was unable to obtain the payload at the time of analysis.\n\n\"The targeted approach employed by this malware, along with the complexity of its multi-stage targeted payload, distinguishes it from the more generic open-source malware threats we have encountered thus far, highlighting the advancements that malicious packages have made recently,\" Jonathan Sar Shalom, director of threat research at JFrog Security Research team, said.\n\n\"This new sophistication of malware underscores why development teams remain vigilant with updates – alongside proactive security research – to defend against emerging threats and maintain software integrity.\"\n\nIn a statement shared with The Hacker News, Grab said that the package chimera-sandbox-extensions was published to PyPI as part of a red teaming exercise conducted by its cybersecurity team.\n\n\"The PyPI package [...] was not created with malicious intent and Grab was not targeted by unknown threat actors,\" Vincent Wong, head of cyber defense at Grab, told the publication. \"The purpose of this simulation was to test and improve our own internal security detection and response capabilities.\"\n\nStating that the activity was \"planned, authorized, and controlled,\" Wong said \"the package itself was not set up to steal credentials or tokens and would not have executed on any non-Grab systems. We understand that from an external perspective, this activity could be misinterpreted as a genuine threat.\"\n\n(The story was updated after publication to include a response from Grab.)",
    "summary_gpt": "Cybersecurity researchers discovered malware-laced npm packages such as eslint-config-airbnb-compat, ts-runtime-compat-check, solders, and @mediawave/lib that executed remote code and downloaded additional payloads. The malicious packages were downloaded hundreds of times before being taken down from npm. The threat actors used multi-stage remote code execution attacks, obfuscation techniques, and complex delivery mechanisms to deploy the Pulsar RAT malware, indicating a sophisticated and malicious intent. The incident highlights the growing threat of crypto malware in the open-source supply chain, with examples of credential stealers, cryptocurrency drainers, and clippers targeting the cryptocurrency and blockchain development ecosystem.",
